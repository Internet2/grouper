## Build

    % cd $GROUPER_BASE/contrib/load/csv2subject
    % ant

--

## Configuration

_csv2subject_ uses Grouper's _conf/hibernate.properties_ file for its
JDBC configuration information.  No additional configuration should be
required.

--

## Run

    % cd $GROUPER_BASE/contrib/load/csv2subject
    % export CLASSPATH=.:/path/to/Grouper.jar:/path/to/Grouper-lib.jar:/path/to/grouper/conf/dir
    % java csv2subject -h
    % java csv2subject -f sample.csv

--

## Input File Format

Each line should have two tokens separated by a comma:

* _subjectID_
* _subjectTypeID_

See the _sample.csv_ file for examples.

--

## Bugs

* No support for removing subjects

As currently written, _csv2subject_ will simply try to add every
subject that it finds in its input file.
