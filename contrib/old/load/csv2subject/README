## Input File Format

Each line should have two tokens separated by a comma:

* _subjectID_
* _subjectTypeID_

See the _sample.csv_ file for examples.

--

## Bugs

* I2MI Subject Interface not being used

_csv2subject_ bypasses the I2MI Subject interface and inserts records
directly into the group registry's _grouper_subject_ table.  One
obvious problem that arises with this is that one may add subjects with
this program that cannot be found by the I2MI Subjectd interface
because an inappropriate _subjectTypeID_ was specified.

* No support for removing subjects

As currently written, _csv2subject_ will simply try to add every
subject that it finds in its input file.
