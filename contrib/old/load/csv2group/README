## Input File Format

Each line should have one of the following formats:

* Add a stem:

    stem,add,<stem>,<extension>

* Add a group

    group,add,<stem>,<extension>

* Add a _person_ as a member

    member,add,<stem>,<extension>,<subjectID>

* Add a _group_ as a member

    member,add,<target stem>,<target extension>,<member stem>,<member extension>

A _#_ at the beginning of a line will treat the entire line as a
comment.

See the _sample.csv_ file for examples.

## Bugs

* No support for removing groups
