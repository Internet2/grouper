This is a new UI for grouper which is ajax based.<br />
Ajax methods are very easily called from screens, JSPs can replace screen sections, there is an API so no project specific javascript is needed.
Packages:<br />
<ul>
<li>beans: stored in container beans for each module</li>
<li>beans/api: common beans across modules</li>
<li>beans/json: beans that go to the screen in json format for ajax</li>
<li>beans/simpleMembershipUpdate: beans for the simpleMembershipUpdate module</li>
<li>exceptions: custom exceptions</li>
<li>j2ee: servlets, filters, etc</li>
<li>serviceLogic: all methods of a signature with instance, void, take in req and resp, are directly callable from anywhere e.g. with ajax.</li>
<li>tags: custom tags and EL functions</li>
<li>util: utility classes (e.g. generic useful static things)</li>

</ul>
