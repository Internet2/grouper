homepage.intro.title=Grouper - getting started
homepage.intro.text=Grouper is a system for creating and maintaining institutional groups in a central repository. Groups might be used for many different reasons, such as maintaining mailing lists, determining which set of people are permitted to access specific web applications, or for sharing resources. The goal is to create a group once, but to use it as often as necessary in as wide a range of systems as possible.

#prefixes for messages
message.Message=Note:
message.ErrorMessage=Error:
message.WarningMessage=Warning:

tooltipTargetted.groupTypes.grouperLoader=Group membership automatically managed via an external source, e.g. SQL query
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderDbName=For sql based loader, this is the name in the grouper-loader.properties of the db connection properties.  If this is set to: grouper    that is a special reserved term for the grouper db (in grouper.hibernate.properties) 
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderIntervalSeconds=If a START_TO_START_INTERVAL schedule type, this is the number of seconds between the start of one run to the start of another run
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderPriority=The loader has a max number of concurrent jobs, and when the max is reached, then jobs are prioritized by this integer.  The higher the better, and the default if not set is 5.
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderQuartzCron=Quartz cron-like string (if CRON schedule type): Seconds Minutes Hours Day-of-Month Month Day-of-Week Year (optional field).  e.g. 0 0 6 * * ? is everyday at 6am
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderQuery=This is the query to run in the DB, which must have certain columns required or optional based on the grouperLoaderType.  e.g. for SQL_SIMPLE, the SUBJECT_ID is required, and the SUBJECT_SOURCE_ID is optional
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderScheduleType=CRON: This is a cron-like syntax that I think is quartz specific, START_TO_START_INTERVAL: This is a repeated schedule that runs based on a delay from the start of one run to the start of another run
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderType=SQL_SIMPLE: a group whose membership is managed from a query.  SQL_GROUP_LIST: requires a GROUP_NAME column in query, so one query can control multiple group memberships
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderAndGroups=If you want to restrict membership in the dynamic group based on other group(s), put the list of group ID paths here comma-separated
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderGroupTypes=If you want types assigned to a group when managed by loader, list the comma separated types
tooltipTargetted.groupFields.grouperLoaderGroupsLike=If you want the group (if not used from anywhere) or members deleted when no longer in loader sql results, list the sql like name, e.g. stem1:stem2:%:%org

tooltipTargetted.groups.summary.id=UUID stands for Universal Unique Identifier, a generated key that is distinct from any other UUID in this or any other system.  <br /><br />The UUID does not change, and can be used as an identifier in other systems.
tooltipTargetted.groups.summary.types=Each group has one or more group types associated with it. The Grouper distribution contains support for a single group type called: base, but sites may register additional types, together with the attributes and lists associated with them, within their Grouper installation. Doing so enables management of groups with a richer information model or a more diverse set of information models.

tooltipTargetted.field.displayName.name=ID Path consists of the unique ID of each enclosing folder plus the group ID, separated by colons.  <br /><br />The ID Path is unique for each group and should rarely change.  It can be used by other systems to refer to this group.
tooltipTargetted.field.displayName.alternateName=Alternate ID Path allows groups to be searchable using an alternate name.  The format is the same as the format of ID Path.<br /><br />This is especially useful when moving a group, which will add the old ID Path of the group as the Alternate ID Path by default.  Like the ID Path, the Alternate ID Path can be used by other systems to refer to this group.

## Define tooltips and terms here:
## tooltips must start with "tooltip."   Terms start with "term."
## there should be one and only one tooltip for a term.
## tooltips and terms are linked by the common name, 
## which is the suffix of the nav.properties key.  e.g. 
## tooltip.group=A group is a collection
## term.group=Group
## term.group=group
## 
## term.groups.3=gro
## term.groups=groups
## term.groups.1=Groups
## term.groups.2=GROUPS
## tooltip.groups=Groups are many people or groups
## 
## these are linked because they all end in "group"
##
## if you only want a tooltip on a certain message (not wherever it appears in text), 
## that is a targetted tooltip
## 
## priv.ADMIN=admin
## tooltipTargetted.priv.ADMIN=Entity may modify group attributes, delete this group, or assign any privilege to any entity
##
## So wherever the message priv.ADMIN shows up, it will have a tooltip of "Entity may..."
## 
## There is another variation on this where the value of the targetted tooltip can be a reference to another tooltip
## 
## tooltipTargettedRef.priv.admin=tooltip.targetted.priv.ADMIN

## Define infodot text here:
## infodot must start with "infodot."   
## the page titles are generated dynamically in the tile: title.jsp and need to be of the format "infodot.title."
## so a name for an infodot is based on title nav.properties id,
## and if there is a subtitle, concatenate.  Then if there is an infodot based on that name, 
## display the infodot. 
##
## The name of the infodot will appear in the HTML comments
## so it is easy to configure.  
##   
## Here is an example comment:
## <!-- trying title infodot with key: infodot.title.groups.all -->
##
## Here is the entry in the nav.properties:
## infodot.title.groups.all=Find a group, click the group name and act on the group (edit properties, show members, etc.) using the buttons at the bottom of the screen

simpleMembershipUpdate.importLabel=Select a comma separated values (CSV) file (e.g. from a spreadsheet program like Excel) which has a column for sourceId, and any of: entityId, entityIdentifier, entityIdOrIdentifier.<br /><br />Alternately, you can upload a text file of entityIdOrIdentifiers, each on a new line, with the first line labeled as: entityIdOrIdentifier

simpleMembershipUpdate.importSubtitle=Import members
infodot.subtitle.simpleMembershipUpdate.importSubtitle=Upload members from a file.  You check replace existing members, or just add new members.<br /><br />The file must be a comma separated values (CSV) file, e.g. from a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel.  There should be a column sourceId, and a column of any of the following: entityId, entityIdentifier, entityIdOrIdentifier.  If there is no sourceId, then all sources will be found (this is less efficient), and if two sources have the same entityId, there will be an error.  Each member is on its own line.  The sourceId is one of a few entity source IDs configured in the Grouper server.<br /><br />The entityId is typically a person ID, the entityIdentifer could be a login ID, and the entityIdOrIdentifier will look by ID, and if not found, look by identifier.<br /><br />Note if you omit the sourceId column, it will be less efficient, but it will still work if you dont have two sources with the same entityId.  This does not need to be CSV, it could be a text file.  e.g. you could upload a text file of entityIdOrIdentifiers, each on a new line, with the first line labeled as: entityIdOrIdentifier<br /><br />Example CSV file 1: <br /><br /><tt>sourceId,entityId<br />someSourceId,12345<br />anotherSourceId,23456</tt><br /><br /><br />Example 2:<br /><br /><tt>sourceId,entityIdentifier<br />someSourceId,sjohnson<br />anotherSourceId,jsmith</tt><br /><br /><br />Example 3:<br /><br /><tt>sourceId,entityIdOrIdentifier<br />someSourceId,45678<br />anotherSourceId,jsmith</tt><br /><br /><br />Example 4:<br /><br /><tt>sourceId,entityId,entityIdentifier<br />someSourceId,45678<br />anotherSourceId,,jsmith</tt><br /><br /><br />Example 5:<br /><br /><tt>entityId<br />56789<br />67890</tt><br /><br /><br />Example 6:<br /><br /><tt>entityIdentifier<br />sjohnson<br />jsmith</tt><br /><br /><br />Example 7:<br /><br /><tt>entityIdOrIdentifier<br />76543<br />jsmith</tt><br /><br /><br />
