     * <p>If a Converter needs to access methods of a specific HierarchicalStreamWriter implementation that are not
     * defined in the HierarchicalStreamWriter interface, it should call this method before casting. This is because
     * the writer passed to the Converter is often wrapped/decorated by another implementation to provide additional
     * functionality (such as XPath tracking).</p>
     *
     * <p>For example:</p>
     * <pre>MySpecificWriter mySpecificWriter = (MySpecificWriter)writer; <b>// INCORRECT!</b>
     * mySpecificWriter.doSomethingSpecific();</pre>

     * <pre>MySpecificWriter mySpecificWriter = (MySpecificWriter)writer.underlyingWriter();  <b>// CORRECT!</b>
     * mySpecificWriter.doSomethingSpecific();</pre>
     *
     * <p>Implementations of HierarchicalStreamWriter should return 'this', unless they are a decorator, in which case
     * they should delegate to whatever they are wrapping.</p>
