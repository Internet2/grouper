Grouper client is a command line utility or java jar for Grouper, LDAP, and custom functions.
It consists of one jar, and any included libraries are in a different package structure
than the original so that they can co-exist with the other libraries.  The entry point is
the class: GrouperClient.  The web service interaction is REST, with generally the non-lite
operations

https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/GrouperWG/Grouper+Client

These are the packages:

api: if using grouper client as a jar, this is the API to use (or GrouperClient class)
examples: some examples of longhand calls. 
util: utility methods
ws and ws.beans: web service xstream beans and related classes

The src/ext folder has all external packages in a consistent package structure.

The build script will build the external source with compiling jars, but then when running
they arent needed.

The logging in a refactored commons-logging which will look for the real log4j, and if not
there, will use an internal log4j

The build script will generate a zip for institutions, or for institutions to distribute
with institutional defaults.

The usage doc is configurable per institution, and gives all the commands available
through the client.
