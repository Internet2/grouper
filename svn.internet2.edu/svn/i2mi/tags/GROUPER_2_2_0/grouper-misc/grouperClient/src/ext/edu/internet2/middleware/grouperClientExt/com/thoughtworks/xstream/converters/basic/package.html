primitives (int, boolean, etc), wrapper objects (Integer, Boolean, etc),
String, StringBuffer, java.util.Date, null, java.net.URL,
java.math.BigInteger and java.math.BigDecimal.</p>

<p>These converters are enabled by default.</p>

<p>All of the basic converters will convert the item
into a single String, with no nested elements.</p>
