     * mySpecificReader.doSomethingSpecific();</pre>

     * <pre>MySpecificReader mySpecificReader = (MySpecificReader)reader.underlyingReader();  <b>// CORRECT!</b>
     * mySpecificReader.doSomethingSpecific();</pre>

     * <p>Implementations of HierarchicalStreamReader should return 'this', unless they are a decorator, in which case
     * they should delegate to whatever they are wrapping.</p>
