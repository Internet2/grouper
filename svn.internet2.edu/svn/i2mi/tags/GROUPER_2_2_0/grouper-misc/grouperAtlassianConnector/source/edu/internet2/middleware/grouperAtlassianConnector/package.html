<p>The Grouper-Atlassian connector connects Atlassian to Grouper via web services and XMPP (optional).</p>
<p>Here is a wiki doc about it: https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/Grouper/Grouper+Atlassian+connector</p>
<p>The base package has the three OpenSymphony provider implementations:
AccessProvider (who is in what group), ProfileProvider (what is someone's
name/email), and CredentialsProvider (can someone log in, authenticate them).
Also there are three other implementations for these that wrap another
implementation (e.g. the default implementation), which log everything
that goes back and forth so you can see how it works (or not).</p>
<p>The external authentication package gives an implementation for 
getting the user from the apache plugin (e.g. shib or cosign).  Also
it provides a useful backdoor for admins to test access (you can
disable this in prod).</p>
<p>The xmpp package provides an implementation for the GrouperClient XMPP
handler to handle XMPP messages and clear the various caches</p>
