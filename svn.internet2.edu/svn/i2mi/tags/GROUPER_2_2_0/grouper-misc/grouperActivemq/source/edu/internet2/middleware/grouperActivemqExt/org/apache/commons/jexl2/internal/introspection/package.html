        Provides low-level introspective services.
        <p>
            This internal package is not intended for public usage and there is <b>no</b>
            guarantee that its public classes or methods will remain as is in subsequent
            versions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IntrospectorBase, ClassMap, MethodKey, MethodMap form the
            base of the introspection service. They allow to describe classes and their
            methods, keeping them in a cache (@see IntrospectorBase) to speed up property
            getters/setters and method discovery used during expression evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cache materialized in Introspector creates one entry per class containing a map of all
            accessible public methods keyed by name and signature.
