 * This interface declares how to resolve a namespace from its name; it is used by the interpreter during evalutation.
 * <p>
 * In JEXL, a namespace is an object that serves the purpose of encapsulating functions; for instance,
 * the "math" namespace would be the proper object to expose functions like "log(...)", "sinus(...)", etc.
 * </p>
 * In expressions like "ns:function(...)", the resolver is called with resolveNamespace("ns").
 * <p>
 * JEXL itself reserves 'jexl' and 'ujexl' as namespaces for internal purpose; resolving those may lead to unexpected
 * results.
 * </p>
