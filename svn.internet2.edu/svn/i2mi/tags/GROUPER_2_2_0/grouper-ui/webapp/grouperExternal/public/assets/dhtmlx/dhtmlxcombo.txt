The combobox queries the server too quickly. Is there a way to configure a delay so that it doesnt query the server until after 500 milliseconds after there is no more typing?

Thanks,
Chris


Hello, 

combo doesn't provide a ready solution to do that. But you can try to modify dhtmlxcombo.js, line 667 as follows (but this solution isn't supported)

if (this._filter) return this.filterSelf((ev==8)||(ev==46));

replace with 

var self=this;
var km = (ev==8)||(ev==46);
if (self._suggest) clearTimeout(self._suggest);
self._suggest = setTimeout(function(){
  if (self._filter) return self.filterSelf(km);
},500)

Add this to the css to remove the images on the drop downs

/* dont show pulldown on comboboxes */
img.dhx_combo_img {
  display: none;
}
