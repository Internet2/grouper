<p>This package contains all the Struts action classes (referenced in struts-config.xml) 
  which process user inputs and interact with the Grouper API. The Javadoc for 
  individual action classes indicates which parameters (from <em>HttpServletRequest</em>), 
  attributes (from <em>HttpServletRequest</em> or <em>HttpSession</em>) and cookies, 
  are read or written* by an action class. </p>
<p>Action classes which interact with the Grouper API should extend GrouperCapableAction, 
  which gives access to an appropriate GrouperSession and various utility methods.</p>
<p>When customising the Grouper UI it may be necessary to change the behaviour 
  of an existing action. This may be achieved in one of 3 ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there is no alternative, write a new class and override the action configuration 
    in struts-config.xml to use the new action class. This should only be necessary 
    if an action carries out an irreversible operation, however, consider the 
    remaining options first.</li>
  <li>Write a new action class which is <em>called</em> before or after the existing 
    action. This may be achieved by: 
    <ul>
      <li>reconfiguring forwards from other actions, however, this approach will 
        not work if an action is usually referenced directly in HTML</li>
      <li>reconfigure forwards from the action class you are modifying such that 
        the new action class is called after the original has finished its work</li>
      <li>reconfigure the existing action to have a new path. Write a new action 
        class and configure it to have the pat hof th eoriginal action, but forward 
        to the new path for that action. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>extend the existing action class and call <em>super.grouperExecute</em>. 
    This allows you to execute code before and after the original action. You 
    must override the existing Struts configuration to associate the action with 
    your new class.</li>
</ol>
<p>*Request parameters are usually read-only, however, where ActionForm fields 
  are set these are considered to have been written.</p>
