<body>
  This package is all the business logic callble by browser.
  Each method callable must take in a request and response.
  Each method can be called by anyone, so each method must do its own security
  to make sure the logged in user can perform the operation.
<br /><br />
  If the method exits normally, then the servlet will send the json GuiResponseJs
  to the screen.  If the method throws an exception, the servlet will handle it.
  If the method throws a ControllerDone, then the servlet will not send the
  json object (e.g. if sending XML for a rich ajax control)
