# Version 0.9

Released: 20051219

## Changes
* NEW: New public API.
* NEW: New query API.  This includes the ability for sites to create
  their own custom query filters for use within the query API.
* NEW: New access and naming adapter APIs and interfaces.
* NEW: "all" subject that can be assigned memberships and granted
  privileges that maps to all subjects that are identifiable by
  Grouper's Subject API configuration.
* NEW: Event logging
* NEW: Configuration options for controlling what privileges, if any,
  are granted to the "all" subject whenever a new group or stem is
  created.  By default, _READ_ and _VIEW_ are granted to "all" upon
  group creation and no privileges are granted to "all" upon stem
  creation.
* NEW: Subject IDs associated with _Member_ objects within the Groups
  Registry can now be changed with the _Member.setSubjectId()_ method.
* NEW: Internal source adapter for resolving the "root" (_GrouperSystem_)
  and "all" (_GrouperAll_) subjects.  No configuration is necessary to use
  this adapter within Grouper.
* NEW: Experimental wheel-group support.  This is disabled by default.
  If enabled, all members of the group are treated as root-like
  subjects with all access and naming privileges.
* UPDATE: New internals.
* UPDATE: ehcache-based caches for access and naming privilege resolution.
* UPDATE: Grouper source adapter no longer needs to be configured
  within _conf/sources.xml_.
* UPDATE: License changed to Apache License, Version 2.0
