# Version 0.5.5

Released 20050415

## Changes

* Updated: Hibernate internals completely rewritten to improve session
  and transaction handling
* Updated: New and more thoroughly tested implementation of the
  memberOf algorithm.  In addition, we are now tracking the entire via
  chain for effective memberships.

  namespaces (GrouperStem)
* New: GrouperGroup.hasMember() method for verifying whether a member
  belongs to a group (#328)
* New: GrouperMember.isMember() method for verifying whether a member
  belongs to a group (#328)
* New: GrouperStem.stems() method to retrieve immediate child
  namespaces within a namespace
* New: GrouperStem.groups() method to retrieve immediate child groups
  within a namespace
* New: GrouperSession objects now serializable (#296)
* New: More detailed reporting (via exceptions) of errors caused
  by various runtime error conditions 
* New: Now using Commons DBCP by default for connection pooling
* New: Now using Hibernate named queries defined as defined in
  _conf/Grouper.hbm.xml_
* New: Use Ant's SQL task to to create, initialize and reset
  HSQLDB database (#287)
* Fixed: Removed calls to system.exit() (#179) 
  (David Langenberg, The University Of Chicago)
* Fixed: sessionID generation bug (#278)
* Fixed: Effective membership bug with circular group memberships (#286)
* New: GrouperField objects now have public instance methods 
  for getting information about the field
* Fixed: Effective membership now working with lists other than
  "members" as well as with the default Access and Naming privilege
  interfaces
* New: commons-dbcp 1.2.1 .jar file
* New: commons-pool 1.2 .jar file
* New: Hibernate's ODMG interface .jar 
* Updated: Hibernate .jar from 2.1.7c to 2.1.8
* Updated: HSQLDB .jar from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2.11
* Updated csv2group to handle comments in input files and the -c and -q
  options

## Incompabilities

* Databases created with Grouper 0.5 will not work with this release.
* Runtime access to Access and Naming privilege implementations moved
  from _Grouper_ to _GrouperSession_.
* Removed _GrouperSession_ argument requirement for most instance
  method calls.

## Known Bugs

* Significant via chain duplication as reuse between list values is not
  working.
* Via chains are not deleted when they are no longer in use.
* Logging is not especially effective or useful.
