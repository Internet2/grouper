# Version HEAD

## Changes

* NEW: VIEW Access privilege (#339)
* NEW: _GrouperQuery_ now has _base(), _group()_ and _namespace()_
  filter methods
* NEW: _GrouperQuery_ now has _getGroups()_, _getListValues()_,
  _getMembers()_ and _getStems()_ methods, replacing the _query()_
  method
* NEW: PostgreSQL now a supported backend (#169)
  (Simon McLeish, London School of Economics)
* NEW: _displayName_ is now automatically populated and maintained (#270)

* UPDATE: _GrouperSubject_ class renamed to _SubjectFactory_
* UPDATE: _Grouper.hasSubjectType()_ replaced by _SubjectFactory.hasType()_
* UPDATE: _Grouper.subjectTypes()_ replaced by _SubjectFactory.types()_

* FIX: Default privilege implementations would attempt to revoke
  effective list values under select circumstances which would cause an
  exception to be thrown. (#361)
* FIX: _hasMember()_ would return incorrect results when a member was
  both immediate and effective (#360)

* REMOVED: Stems can no longer be members or subjects
* REMOVED: _GrouperQuery.query()_ method

* Fixed: STEM, not ADMIN, needed to modify namespace attributes (#352)
* Fixed: Added NullGrouperAttribute class (which extends GrouperAttribute) 
  to handle group attributes that either do not have values or have had
  their values deleted. (#356)
* Fixed: GrouperMember.load(session, subject) replaces
  GrouperMember.load(subject) (#348)
* Fixed: GrouperGroup.loadByID() now returns properly casted GrouperGroup
  objects (#349)

# Version 0.5.5

Released 20050415

## Changes

* Updated: Hibernate internals completely rewritten to improve session
  and transaction handling
* Updated: New and more thoroughly tested implementation of the
  memberOf algorithm.  In addition, we are now tracking the entire via
  chain for effective memberships.
* New: Improved Oracle compatibility and support
* New: Created logical distinction between groups (GrouperGroup) and
  namespaces (GrouperStem)
* New: GrouperGroup.hasMember() method for verifying whether a member
  belongs to a group (#328)
* New: GrouperMember.isMember() method for verifying whether a member
  belongs to a group (#328)
* New: GrouperStem.stems() method to retrieve immediate child
  namespaces within a namespace
* New: GrouperStem.groups() method to retrieve immediate child groups
  within a namespace
* New: GrouperSession objects now serializable (#296)
* New: More detailed reporting (via exceptions) of errors caused
  by various runtime error conditions 
* New: Now using Commons DBCP by default for connection pooling
* New: Now using Hibernate named queries defined as defined in
  _conf/Grouper.hbm.xml_
* New: Use Ant's SQL task to to create, initialize and reset
  HSQLDB database (#287)
* Fixed: Removed calls to system.exit() (#179) 
  (David Langenberg, The University Of Chicago)
* Fixed: sessionID generation bug (#278)
* Fixed: Effective membership bug with circular group memberships (#286)
* New: GrouperField objects now have public instance methods 
  for getting information about the field
* Fixed: Effective membership now working with lists other than
  "members" as well as with the default Access and Naming privilege
  interfaces
* New: commons-dbcp 1.2.1 .jar file
* New: commons-pool 1.2 .jar file
* New: Hibernate's ODMG interface .jar 
* Updated: Hibernate .jar from 2.1.7c to 2.1.8
* Updated: HSQLDB .jar from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2.11
* Updated csv2group to handle comments in input files and the -c and -q
  options

## Incompabilities

* Databases created with Grouper 0.5 will not work with this release.
* Runtime access to Access and Naming privilege implementations moved
  from _Grouper_ to _GrouperSession_.
* Removed _GrouperSession_ argument requirement for most instance
  method calls.

## Known Bugs

* Significant via chain duplication as reuse between list values is not
  working.
* Via chains are not deleted when they are no longer in use.
* Logging is not especially effective or useful.
