This guide will help you to build and operate Grouper.  As Grouper
is still early in its development cycle, there is little practical
implementation experience and thus this guide is far from a
comprehensive treatment of the topic.  Our strategy is to bootstrap
the documentation process by providing enough information for early
adopters to begin using Grouper and to subsequently contribute to
the enhancement of this document by their experiences.
</p>
<p>
Along with obtaining Grouper (see the MACE-Dir-Groups website
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/grouper/">&lt;http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/grouper/&gt;</a>
for instructions), adopters should join the 
<a href="https://mail.internet2.edu/wws/info/grouper-users">grouper-users</a>
and possibly the 
<a href="https://mail.internet2.edu/wws/info/grouper-dev">grouper-dev</a>
mailing lists for implementation assistance and to discuss the further
development of Grouper.

<h2>Introduction To Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
Grouper is an open source toolkit for managing groups.  It provides an
API for supporting basic group management capabilities - creation,
reading, updating and deletion of groups from a Groups Registry, a
central information repository complementary to a site's Person
Registry.  Grouper also supports automated and manual maintenance of
groups, subgroups, limited querying capabilities, support for multiple
database backends and the ability to integrate with existing identity
management (IDM) infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html">Grouper Phase 1 Specifications</a>
the <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html#heading_2_Comp">components &amp; architecture section</a>
depicts the major components of Grouper and their relation to
an implementation site's existing identity management
infrastructure. Those components are an API, a relational database
called the Groups Registry and one or more user interfaces for managing
groups.  While the API and other design details have changed since the
<i>Grouper Phase 1 Specification</i>  was released, the architectural
drawing remains accurate.   Future Grouper releases will provide an
improved and more feature-rich API, UI enhancements, aging tasks,
loading and provisioning support and performance improvements.  A
broad roadmap of the Grouper development cycle is below:

by using the sample programs that come with Grouper.
</p>
<p>
In addition to this implementation guide, the Grouper distribution
contains javadoc (<tt>$GROUPER/doc/javadoc</tt>) that provides
some information on using the API and a list of changes from prior
releases (<tt>$GROUPER/doc/NEWS</tt>).  If this guide and the
<i>NEWS</i> file appear in conflict, <i>NEWS</i> should be considered
authoritative.  We use the symbol <i>$GROUPER</i> throughout this
document to refer to the top level of your Grouper distribution.
</p>
<p>
The best source of practical information on using the Grouper API to
can currently be found in the contributed programs
(<tt>$GROUPER/contrib/</tt>) and Grouper's test suite
(<tt>$GROUPER/java/tests/</tt>), both of which are included with
the Grouper distribution.  They exercise many functional aspects of the
API and the latter serves as a means of assessing that a Grouper
installation is working properly.  A Grouper development guide and
improved sample programs are under construction and will be available
at a later date.

<h2>The Groups Registry</h2>

<h3>Groups And Namespaces</h3>
</div>
<p>
Grouper works by managing two principal types of objects: groups
and namespaces.  A group is a list of members and various attributes.
A namespace is a context in which a group or a another namespace
may be located and and named along with various attributes.  Both
groups and namespaces may have a number of different privileges
assigned to them.  From the perspective of information management
a Grouper deployment is defined by which subjects (people, applications,
groups) have what access to each namespace and group.
</p>
<p>
The Groups Registry uses a RDBMS to store information on namespaces,
groups, memberships and possibly privileges.  Grouper is
currently known to work and tested with HSQLDB, PostgreSQL and Oracle.

<h3>Group And Namespace Attributes</h3>
</div>
<p>
Attributes are predefined single-valued pairs that may be assigned to both
groups and namespaces.  The names of attributes are <b>case
sensitive</b> while the values are typically not.
<p>
Groups and namespaces have the following set of attributes:

    members of a group.  If a group is made a member of another
    group, the members of the group will also be made members.</td>

</p>
<!-- registry_lists -->

<div class="subsection">
<a name="registry_naming"/>
<h3>Naming Examples</h3>
</div>
<p>
The <a href="#table_attrs">attributes table</a> shows that groups and
namespaces have the same naming attributes (<i>stem</i>,
<i>extension</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>displayExtension</i> and
<i>displayName</i>) with the same semantics.  Groups and namespaces are
created and named within namespaces and namespaces can be arranged in
either a flat or hierarchical style as desired by the implementation
site.
</p>
<p>
Since a group must be named within a namespace, it is necessary to
create a namespace before any groups can be created. Namespaces are
currently modeled internally as groups of <i>naming</i> type.  The
following code example demonstrates the creation of a namespace and a
group within that namespace:
</p>
<pre>
  /*
   * Create a root-level namespace with the extension "uofc".
   */
  String        ns_extn   = "uofc";
  GrouperStem   ns        = GrouperStem.create(s, ns_extn);

  /*
   * Create a group with the extension "exec_council" within the "uofc"
   * namespace.  
   */
  String        grp_stem  = "uofc";
  String        grp_extn  = "exec_council";
  GrouperGroup  g         = GrouperGroup.create(s, grp_stem, grp_extn);
</pre>
<p>
A <i>hierarchy delimiter</i> is used in string representations of the names of
groups and namespaces. This delimiter is placed between every
<i>stem</i> and <i>extension</i>.  The delimiter is a ":" and this character can
not be used as part of the extension for either namespaces or groups.
</p>
<p>
Each newly created group or namespace contributes just one new element,
the <i>extension</i>, to its accumulative name.  The <i>displayName</i>
of groups and namespaces is likewise accumulative - that's why the
<i>name</i> and <i>displayName</i> attributes are system maintained
and read-only. Here are some further examples illustrating all of
the naming attributes of several namespaces and groups.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the example of the namespace and group created above,
below are the attributes values that each would have:
</p>
<p>
<table id="table" align="center" border="1" width="60%">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th colspan="2">namespace uofc</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

  <td class="r">&nbsp;</td>

  <td class="c"><i>extension</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>

<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>displayExtension</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>

<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>name</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>

  <td class="c"><i>displayName</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>

</p>
<p>
<table id="table" align="center" border="1" width="60%">

  <th colspan="2">group uofc:exec_council</th>

  <td class="r">exec_council</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>displayName</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc:exec_council</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>
If we then assign the namespace a <i>displayExtension</i> value of
"The University Of Chicago", the namespace and group will have the
following attribute values:
</p>
<p>
<table id="table" align="center" border="1" width="60%">

  <th colspan="2">namespace uofc</th>

<p>
Next we'll give the group a <i>displayExtension</i> value of "Executive

</p>
<p>
This set of examples illuminates at least two things. First, that it
would be a good idea for implementation sites to establish conventions
for the assignment of naming attributes. An example of such is 
<a href="http://techag.uchicago.edu/idm-wg/attrValueBNF.txt">here</a>
(note that it was created before Grouper's design encompassed
<i>displayNames</i> and at that time the term <i>descriptor</i>
was used where we now say <i>extension</i>).
</p>
<p>
Second, that the names of groups, as with the titles of many types of
things, influence people's initial expectations of the meaning of
those groups. Seeing "Enterprise Information Systems staff" by itself
gives a different impression than seeing it in the context of
"Biological Sciences Division". That, in part, motivates the care taken
in the design of Grouper's <a href="#registry_privs">privilege
model</a>.
</p>
<!-- registry_naming -->
<!-- registry_privs -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="registry_privs"/>
<h3>Privileges</h3>
</div>
<p>
There are two categories of privileges in Grouper: <i>Access</i> and
<i>Naming</i>.  Access privileges determine what a subject can do
to a group. Naming privileges determine what a subject can do to a
namespace.  All Grouper API methods are subject to the Grouper
privilege model and privileges can be assigned to subjects of any type,
including groups.  See <a href="#integrate_privs">Integrating
Privileges</a> for more information on the Grouper privilege model.
</p>
<p>
The access and naming privileges are listed in the following tables:

<h2>Building Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Get the Java SDK.</p>
    <p>The SDK may be downloaded from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">&lt;http://java.sun.com/j2se/&gt;</a>.
    The JRE alone is not sufficient.</p></li>
  <li><p>Get Ant</p>
    <p>Ant may be downloaded from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">&lt;http://ant.apache.org&gt;</a>.</p>
    <p>Directions for installing Ant are in the unpacked distribution
    at <i>docs/manual/install.html#installing</i>. You may need to
    copy <i>tools.jar</i> from <tt>$JAVA_HOME/lib</tt> to
    <tt>$ANT_HOME/lib</tt> to get ant working properly.</p></li>
  <li>Change directory to <tt>$GROUPER</tt>.</li>
  <li><p><tt>ant build</tt></p>
    <p>This will compile Grouper and place the class files under
    the <tt>$GROUPER/build</tt> directory.</p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant db-init</tt></p>
    <p>This will create a Groups Registry in
    <tt>$GROUPER/dist/run/</tt> directory using the default
    HSQLDB RDBMS.</p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant test</tt></p>
    <p>This will compile and run the Grouper test suite to exercise the
    API and ensure that Grouper is properly configured.</p>
    <p><b>Note: Running the test suite is destructive and will
    delete all groups and memberships in the Groups Registry.  Do
    not run the test suite against production data.</b></p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant db</tt> [optional]</p>
    <p>This will launch HSQLDB's GUI database manager.  From within the
    manager you can run SQL queries against the Groups Registry.</p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant dist</tt> [optional]</p>
    <p>This creates two .jar files within
    <tt>$GROUPER/dist/lib/</tt>.  One file contains all of the
    Grouper class files while the other contains all of the third
    party .jar files used by Grouper.  This isn't required but does
    ease <i>$CLASSPATH</i> configuration.</p></li>

<h2>Configuring Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
Grouper requires very little configuration and does not require any by
default.  All Grouper configuration files are stored in
<tt>$GROUPER/conf/</tt>.  The five configuration files that you
<b>may</b> want to adjust and reasons why are described below.
</p>
<h3>hibernate.properties</h3>
<p>
Update this file if you are using an alternate database or intend to run
programs from somewhere other than <i>$GROUPER</i>.  You will want to
review and adjust as necessary the <i>hibernate.dialect</i> and
<i>hibernate.connection.*</i> parameters.
</p>
<h3>log4j.properties</h3>
Update this file if you intend to run programs from somewhere other
than <i>$GROUPER</i>.  Set the <i>log4j.appender.rfile.File</i>
parameter to the absolute path of your desired logfile location.
</p>
<h3>sources.xml</h3>
<p>
This is the configuration file for Grouper's I2MI Subject API resolver.
The I2MI Subject API is used to map an external IDM infrastructure to
Grouper internals and can be used to identify people, groups and
applications from a variety of internal and external to Grouper sources
of authority.  Grouper's default configuration uses Grouper as its
source of authority for subjects of type <i>group</i> and several
tables within the Groups Registry for subjects of type <i>person</i>.
If you wish to use additional or different sources, you will need
to adjust this file.  At this time, the javadoc provided with each
source adapter is probably the best location for configuration
information.  Please <b>do not</b> change the source for subjects
of type <i>group</i>.
</p>
<p>
See <span class="TODO">$SECTION</span> for more information on the I2MI
Subject and how Grouper utilizes it.
</p>
<h3>grouper.properties</h3>
<p>
Update this file if intending to use an alternate privilege
implementation.  See <a href="#integrate_privs">Integrating
Privileges</a> for more information.
</p>
<h3>ehcache.xml</h3>
<p>
ehcache is used by Hibernate to cache objects and query results in both
memory and on disk.  Grouper comes with a default and unoptimized
configuration.  Depending upon your usage and the size of your Groups
Registry, you may want to adjust your cache settings.  See the 
<a href="http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/">ehcache
documentation</a> for more details.

<h2>Running Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
As Grouper is currently just a database and a Java API for exercising
that database, there is no "Groups Registry server" that needs to
be running to interact with the Groups Registry.  All that is necessary
is that one be able to connect to your configured database and that the
following items be in your classpath:
<ul>
  <li>full pathname of the <i>Grouper.jar</i> file produced by <tt>ant
    dist</tt></li>
  <li>full pathname of the <i>Grouper-lib.jar</i> file produced by
    <tt>ant dist</tt></li>
  <li>full pathname of the directory containing Grouper's configuration
    files.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<!-- integrate_privs -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="integrate_privs"/>
<h3>Privileges</h3>
</div>
<p>
The Grouper API provides and uses abstracted interfaces
(<i>GrouperAccess</i> and <i>GrouperNaming</i>) to access and
manage the Access and Naming privileges.  This design permits
implementation sites to replace Grouper's default implementation
of either or both of these interfaces if they desire to integrate
with an already existing external privilege management system.  It
is anticipated that Grouper will provide support for integrating
with a
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/signet/">Signet</a> 
<span class="TODO">Privilege Registry</a> in the future.
</p>
<p>
The default implementations of the Access and Naming privileges that
are used by Grouper uses group list values to represent assigned
privileges.  Because privileges are modeled as list values in these
implementations one is able to take advantage of Grouper's list
management capabilities.  In particular, this means that one can use
subgroups to provide for the interitance of privileges.  In addition,
one will be able to take advantage of group math and aging tasks to
provide an even richer privilege management environment.
</p>
<p>
If a site desires to replace one or both of the default privilege
implementations, see the <i>GrouperAccess</i> and <i>GrouperNaming</i>
javadoc for information on the interface that must be implemented.  In
addition, the <i>interface.access</i> and <i>interface.naming</i>
configuration parameters in <tt>$GROUPER/conf/grouper.properties</tt>
will need to be adjusted to reflect the privilege implementation being
used.

<h2>Extending Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
Grouper does currently provide some ability for sites to extend
Grouper's default behavior and types to better fit local needs.
Currently <span class="TODO">??? <a href="#extend_group_types">group 
types</a> (including attributes and lists) and 
<a href="#extend_privs">privileges</a></span> may be extended
with varying degrees of difficulty.
</p>
<!-- extend_group_types -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="extend_group_types"/>
<h3>Group Types</h3>
</div>
<p>
To support some of the 
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-sage-scenarios-00.html">use cases</a>
identified by MACE-Dir-Groups working group members, Grouper was
designed from the start to enable implementation sites to extend the
set of attributes and lists available to be associated with groups.
This was done by declaring attributes, lists, and their properties in
tables within the Groups Registry rather than having them represented
as static schematic elements of that database. Sets of attributes and
lists are packaged into group types.  This is similar to how schemas
for LDAP directories are managed and extended: LDAP attributes are
packaged into object classes, and each LDAP entry can have a set
of object classes associated with it, allowing different entries
to serve different purposes.  
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, at this time Grouper only allows a single group type to
be assigned to a group.  Thus, if you are extending the Groups Registry
by creating new group types you will currently need to first duplicate
the definition of the <i>base</i> group type and then add any
additional attributes and lists that you may desire.  Grouper ships
with one custom group type: <i>naming</i>.  This type is used
internally to model namespaces.
</p>
<p>
Although it is not currently possible  to extend Grouper's supported
group types, attributes and lists with the API, sites can create
new group types, attributes and lists.  To adjust the schema  you will
need to manually alter the <i>grouper_type</i>, <i>grouper_typeDef</i>
and <i>grouper_field</i> tables within the Groups Registry to
determine the set of attributes and lists that are associated with
an extended group type.  The <tt>$GROUPER/sql/init.sql</tt> file
may provide some guidance on how to update those tables with your
desired extensions.

<h3>Privileges</h3>
</div>
<p>
Although it is not currently possible to extend Grouper's privilege
model with the API, sites that extend the set of <a href="#extend_group_types">attributes
and lists</a> in their deployment can declare which privileges are
needed to read and write each attribute and list.  To adjust the schema
you will need to manually alter the <i>grouper_field</i> table within
the Groups Registry.  The <tt>$GROUPER/sql/init.sql</tt> file may
provide some guidance on how to update this table with your desired
additions.

<h3>3.5. Using Privileges To Distribute Group Management
Capabilities</h3>
</div>
<p>
One of the leading reasons why there is interest in Grouper is that
many sites recognize a need to involve many sources of authority in
managing resource access, distribution lists and application
customization - the types of needs which groups help to satisfy.
Grouper's privilege model supports five ways to distribute
management of groups.
<ol>
  <li>Create a group and assign someone <i>UPDATE</i> privilege to
    it.  This delegates the ability to maintain the group's
    membership.</li>
  <li>Create a group and assign someone <i>ADMIN</i> privilege to it.
    This delegates the ability to manage who can maintain the group's
    membership as well as manage all access to the group.</li>
  <li>Create a namespace and assign someone <i>CREATE</i> privilege
    to it. This delegates the ability to preside over the collection
    of all groups they create in that namespace.</li>
  <li>Create a namespace and assign someone <i>STEM</i> privilege
    to it.  They can rule over an entire hierarchy of namespaces and
    groups, all sharing a common root namespace.</li>
  <li>Create a group and assign <i>OPTIN</i> and/or <i>OPTOUT</i>
    privilege to other groups. Subjects belonging to those other
    groups are entitled to manage their own membership in the
    group.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
An example of an actual scenario for delegation of group management to
solve an access control problem can be found in
<a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/%7Etbarton/camp-200411/20041117-authz.ppt">&lt;http://home.uchicago.edu/~tbarton/camp -200411/20041117-authz.ppt</a>.
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_3.6"/>
<h3>3.6. Subject Identifiers</h3>
</div>
<p>
Most often the members of your groups will be people and other groups.
But they might also be of any other type (applications or computers,
for example) for which you now or eventually will manage identities.
Grouper supports a site-defined set of <i>subjectTypes</i> (see 
<a href="#section_4.3">section 4.3</a> below).
</p>
<p>
Identifiers and their management can get complicated. They can be
revoked or not, re-assigned or not, lucent or opaque, etc. Depending on
such characteristics, a given identifier might be a good or bad choice
to use in the context of managing the identified subject's group
memberships.
</p>
<p>
For example, a username is often lucent - easily remembered by the
person to whom it is associated. But it may also be revokable, meaning
that it no longer refers to that person (perhaps they have a new one),
or even re-assignable, meaning that it might refer to some other person
at a later time. If a username is used to record membership, username
changes must trigger corresponding membership changes. A username is
better suited to authentication than it is to indicating membership.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, an opaque registryID (machine, not human, readable)
that never changes is great for membership, but lousy for
authentication - it might not even be known by the person to whom
it is associated. How would I identify myself to Grouper if I wished to
opt-in to a list or manage a group?
</p>
<p>
Grouper accommodates subject identifier issues in two ways. First, it
maintains guids for every subject and group within the Groups
Registry.  These are never exposed by the API, but are associated
with externally supplied subject identifiers in the <i>grouper_member</i>
table.  This approach allows the identifier associated with a given
subject to be changed without any need to change actual memberships
(although the supporting <i>GrouperMember</i> method is not yet
available via the Grouper API).
</p>
<p>
Second, during the 0.6 release cycle, the Grouper API will incorporate
an identifier lookup and translation service called the Subject
Interface being co-developed by the Grouper and Signet projects.
The Subject Interface is used to lookup subjects that are presented
with an identifier in one namespace and obtain identifiers in other
namespaces for that subject.  That means that it can translate a
username into a registryID and vice-versa, for example. So, when a
user authenticates to an application using the Grouper API, that
application can use the Subject Interface to fetch an identifier
for that person chosen by the site for use in memberships. Similarly,
when a membership in the Groups Registry is to be expressed elsewhere,
the identifier used for group members can be translated by a
provisioning connector by use of the Subject Interface into one
that is suitable in the provisioned context.

<h2>4. Integration Tasks</h2>
</div>
<p>
This section is intended to demonstrate how to integrate Grouper with
your existing infrastructure and practices.  Unfortunately, because of
where Grouper is in its development process, practical integration
remains sparse.
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_4.1"/>
<h3>4.1. Using Your Own RDBMS</h3>
</div>
<p>
Grouper uses Hibernate 
(<a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">&lt;http://www.hibernate.org/&gt;</a>) 
for object persistence.  As Hibernate uses JDBC to speak to a RDBMS, it
should not be difficult to configure Grouper to work with your
preferred database backend.  Grouper is currently being tested against
and should work with HSQLDB (the default), PostgreSQL and Oracle.
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_4.1.1"/>
<h3>4.1.1 Using HSQLDB</h3>
</div>
<p>
Grouper uses HSQLDB as its default RDBMS and no additional
configuration is required.
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_4.1.2"/>
<h3>4.1.2 Using PostgreSQL</h3>
</div>
<p>
PostgreSQL is a supported Grouper backend and should only require small
configuration changes to use.  Grouper also includes a PostgreSQL
JDBC driver; see <tt>$GROUPER/java/lib/README</tt> for version
information.  to use PostgreSQL you will need to:
<ol>
  <li>Uncomment the PostgreSQL section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/hibernate.properties</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Uncomment the PostgreSQL section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/sources.xml</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Set <i>sql.type</i> to <i>postgres</i> in 
    <tt>$GROUPER/build.xml</tt></li>
</ol>
</p>

<div>
<a name="section_4.1.3"/>
<h3>4.1.3 Using Oracle</h3>
</div>
<p>
Oracle is a supported Grouper backend and should only require small
configuration changes to use.  An Oracle JDBC driver is not currently
distributed with Grouper.  To use Oracle you will need to:
<ol>
  <li>Uncomment the Oracle section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/hibernate.properties</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Uncomment the Oracle section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/sources.xml</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Set <i>sql.type</i> to <i>oracle</i> in 
    <tt>$GROUPER/build.xml</tt></li>
</ol>
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_4.1.4"/>
<h3>4.1.4 Using Other Databases</h3>
</div>
<p>
While Grouper should work with other databases, it has not yet been
tested with them nor does it provide support for them as shipped.
To use an alternate database you will need to:
<ol>
  <li>Modify Grouper's Hibernate configuration file
    (<tt>$GROUPER/conf/hibernate.properties</tt>) to connect to
    your RDBMS</li>
  <li>Modify Grouper's Subject API configuration file
    (<tt>$GROUPER/conf/sources.xml</tt>) to connect to
    your RDBMS</li>
  <li>Create <tt>$GROUPER/sql/schema-$YOUR_DB_TYPE.sql</tt></li>
  <li>Create <tt>$GROUPER/sql/test-data-$YOUR_DB_TYPE.sql</tt></li>
  <li>Set <i>sql.type</i> to <i>$YOUR_DB_TYPE</i> in 
    <tt>$GROUPER/build.xml</tt></li>
</ol>
If you do use an alternate database that is not natively supported by
Grouper, please contact the grouper-dev list with your results and
schema files.
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_4.2"/>
<h3>4.2. SQL Tuning</h3>
</div>
<p>
As development progresses, general performance tuning and RDBMS-specific
suggestions will be made available.
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_4.3"/.
<h3>4.3. Getting Subjects Into Grouper</h3>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#section_3.6">Section 3.6</a> broached issues surrounding
the choice of subject identifiers for use with Grouper. Having made
a choice, this section tells you how to get those identifiers
integrated with Grouper. You may want to stare at the
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/groupsRegERD4.4.gif">Groups Registry ERD</a> 
while reading this section.
</p>
<p>
The <i>grouper_subjectType</i> table is used to declare what
<i>subjectTypes</i> are in a Grouper deployment, and, for each type,
the name of the adapter class that will be called to lookup and load
objects of each type. Grouper installs with this table defaulted
to support two subject types: <i>person</i> and <i>group</i>. The
default <i>person</i> adapter class, called
<i>SubjectTypeAdapterPersonImpl</i>, provides sites with a bootstrap
mechanism for getting subjects into the Groups Registry.  It just
looks in the <i>grouper_subject</i> table to qualify that the
<i>subjectID</i> supplied to the Grouper API is valid.  Using 
<i><a href="#csv2subject">csv2subject</a></i>, you can populate the the
<i>grouper_subject</i> table with all of the <i>subjectIDs</i>
encompassed by your Grouper deployment.
</p>
<p>
A better means of integrating your person type <i>subjectIDs</i> with Grouper
is to supply your own adapter class for the <i>person subjectType</i>.
This class will need to validate and create subject objects given a
<i>subjectID</i>.  For example, you might write an adapter class that
hit your LDAP directory or your Person Registry directly to validate
that a <i>subjectID</i> is in fact one that is valid for a group
management operation. This would remove the need to maintain the
<i>grouper_subject</i> table - its sole purpose in the Groups
Registry is to bootstrap subjects into Grouper.
</p>
<p>
With implementation of the Subject Interface, anticipated to be
included in the Grouper 0.6 release cycle, a richer set of subject
data obtained from your identity management operation will be made
available to implement identifier translation capabilities as
described in <a href="#section_3.6">section 3.6</a> and subject
search capabilities in support of the Grouper UI. The default adapter class for
the <i>person subjectType</i> in Grouper 0.6 will support these identifier
search and translation capabilities by reliance on the
<i>grouper_subjectAttribute</i> table. That will allow you to bootstrap your
Grouper deployment by maintaining this table until such time as you can
supply your own <i>person subjectType</i> adapter class with the requisite
functionality.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The adapter class for the <i>group subjectType</i> should not
be changed!  Else why are you bothering with Grouper?
</p>
<div class="subsection">
<a name="section_4.4"/>
<h3>4.4. Loaders And Provisioning Connectors</h3>
</div>
<p>
Loaders and provisioning connectors are defined in the 
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html#heading_2_Comp">components &amp; architecture section</a>
in <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html">Grouper Phase 1 Specifications</a>. 
Loaders are automation process that use the Grouper API to load and
maintain the Groups Registry from other sources, and provisioning
connectors are automation processes that use the Grouper API to
extract information from the Groups Registry and represent it in
other databases, directories, etc.
</p>
<p>
As this is an early release, there is as yet no contributed code
that has been used to get real data into or out of Grouper, although
the contributed applications discussed in 
<a href="#section_2.4">section 2.4</a> above could be used as a
starting point for developing them. So this section will merely
identify some of Grouper's capabilities relative to loaders and
provisioning connectors.
</p>
<p>
All interactions with the Grouper API are conducted within a session
that is constrained by the privileges of the session's <i>subjectID</i>,
so each loader and provisioning connector will need to be assigned one.
The default <i>GrouperSystem</i> subject can be used, or others may be
assigned as necessary to meet site-specific security requirements.
</p>
<p>
The Grouper API does not authenticate the <i>subjectID</i> asserted by an API
client. It is assumed that sites will secure access to the Grouper API
as they do other infrastructure services, with a combination of host
and application platform security measures.
</p>
<p>
Loaders and provisioning connectors may use the Subject Interface,
after its incorporation into Grouper in release 0.6, to lookup and
translate external identifiers for subjects into those selected for use
as Grouper <i>subjectIDs</i>.
</p>
<p>
The <i>GrouperQuery</i> class encapsulates the search filters implemented in
Grouper for selecting groups. These include
<ul>
  <li>specifying a time before which the group was modified</li>
  <li>specifying a time after which the group was modified</li>
  <li>specifying a time before which the group was created</li>
  <li>specifying a time after which the group was created</li>
  <li>specifying a group <i>type</i></li>
  <li>specifying whether the group has immediate or effective
    memberships, or both.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
These filters can be combined to constrain a single search. A search is
executed using the selected filters by the <i>GrouperQuery.query()</i> method.
Further search capabilities are slated for later releases of Grouper.
See <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-search-00.html">Grouper API Search &amp; Browse Capabilities</a>
for details.
</p>
<p>
Grouper currently has no way to limit the number of objects returned by a
search.  Search result limits will be added in a future release.
</p>
<p>
<i>GrouperQuery.query()</i> and the <i>GrouperGroup</i> and
<i>GrouperMember</i> <i>list*</i> methods for listing immediate and
effective memberships return lists of <i>GrouperList</i> objects.
The <i>GrouperList.group()</i> and <i>GrouperList.member()</i>
methods convert <i>GrouperList</i> objects into <i>GrouperGroup</i>
or <i>GrouperMember</i> objects, respectively.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a list value that is a <i>GrouperMember</i> object representing
an effective membership, the <i>via group</i> for that membership is returned
by the <i>GrouperList.via()</i> method. A <i>via group</i> is a
group in which a member has an immediate membership that qualifies
it for effective membership by virtue of a subgroup or compound
group relationship between the via group and the group in which the
member has effective membership (the via group concept is discussed
in more detail in 
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html">Grouper Phase 1 Specifications</a>). 
If there's more than one via group qualifying a given member's
effective membership in some group, then the list of <i>GrouperList</i>
objects returned by <i>GrouperGroup.listEffVals()</i> or
<i>GrouperMember.listEffVals()</i> contains a <i>GrouperMember</i>
object for each via group. This allows API clients like loaders and
provisioning connectors to determine which immediate memberships
must be removed in order to make a given effective membership go
away.
</p>
<p>
Each group in the Groups Registry has several <i>operational
attributes</i> associated with it.  These include:
</p>
<p>
<a name="table_7"/>

<div align="center"><b>Table 7 - Operational Attributes For
Groups</b></div>
</p>
<p>
The <i>modifyTime</i> and <i>modifySubject</i> are updated with
each change to any of the group's fields.  A change in effective
membership or effective privilege is not reflected in the values
of these operational attributes.  A request has been made to include
that ability in a future release of Grouper.
</p>
<p>
The <i>memberKey</i> referred to in this table is an internal globally unique
identifier that Grouper assigns to each subject it comes into contact
with. The <i>GrouperGroup.createSubject()</i> and
<i>GrouperGroup.modifySubject()</i> methods return
<i>Subject</i> objects corresponding to this <i>memberKey</i>.

<h3>2.4.1. Sample Subject Loader - csv2subject</h3>
</div>
<p>
Subjects are identifiers for people, groups and other objects that may
be members of a group.  In this release of Grouper, subjects are
maintained in the <i>Subject</i> table within the Groups
Registry.  <i>csv2subject</i> is a simple program for populating that
table.  Subjects and the preferred means of dealing with them are
discussed in sections <a href="#section_3.6">3.6</a> and 
<a href="#section_4.3">4.3</a>.
</p>
<p>
<i>csvsubject</i> is located in <tt>$GROUPER/contrib/load/csv2subject</tt>.  
This program reads in a .csv file containing <i>subjectIDs</i> and
<i>subjectTypeIDs</i> and then inserts the subjects into the Groups
Registry via a direct JDBC connection.  <i>csv2subject</i> uses
Grouper's Hibernate configuration file for its JDBC configuration.
<p>
A sample .csv file is located in the <tt>$GROUPER/contrib/load/csv2subject</tt>
directory.
</p>
<p>
To use <i>csv2subject</i>:
<ol>
  <li>Change to the <tt>$GROUPER/contrib/load/csv2subject</tt>
    directory</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions in the README file</li>
</ol>

A sample .csv file that creates a number of different namespaces,
groups and memberships is located in this directory.  To use the sample
file you will first need to load sample subjects into the Groups
Registry using <a href="#csv2subject">csv2subject</a>.  The sample
subjects are located in <tt>$GROUPER/contrib/load/csv2subject/sample.csv</tt>.
