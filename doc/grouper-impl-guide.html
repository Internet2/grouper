This guide will help you to build and operate Grouper.  As Grouper
is still early in its development cycle, there is little practical
implementation experience and thus this guide is far from a
comprehensive treatment of the topic.  Our strategy is to bootstrap
the documentation process by providing enough information for early
adopters to begin using Grouper and to subsequently contribute to
the enhancement of this document by their experiences.
</p>
<p>
Along with obtaining Grouper (see the 
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/grouper/">MACE-Dir-Groups</a>
website for instructions), adopters should join the
<a href="https://mail.internet2.edu/wws/info/grouper-users">grouper-users</a>
and possibly the 
<a href="https://mail.internet2.edu/wws/info/grouper-dev">grouper-dev</a>
mailing lists for implementation assistance and to discuss the further
development of Grouper.
</p>

<!-- intro -->
<div class="section">
<a name="intro"/>
<h2>1. Introduction To Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
Grouper is an open source toolkit for managing groups.  It provides an
API for supporting basic group management capabilities - creation,
reading, updating and deletion of groups from a Groups Registry, a
central information repository complementary to a site's Person
Registry.  Grouper also supports automated and manual maintenance of
groups, subgroups, limited querying capabilities, support for multiple
database backends and the ability to integrate with existing identity
management (IDM) infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html">Grouper Phase 1 Specifications</a>
the <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html#heading_2_Comp">components &amp; architecture section</a>
depicts the major components of Grouper and their relation to
an implementation site's existing identity management
infrastructure. Those components are an API, a relational database
called the Groups Registry and one or more user interfaces for managing
groups.  While the API and other design details have changed since the
<i>Grouper Phase 1 Specification</i>  was released, the architectural
drawing remains accurate.   Future Grouper releases will provide an
improved and more feature-rich API, UI enhancements, aging tasks,
loading and provisioning support and performance improvements.  A
broad roadmap of the Grouper development cycle is below:

<a href="#build">build</a>, <a href="#config">configure</a> and
<a href="#run">run</a> Grouper; <a href="#integrate">integrating</a>

</p>
<p>
In addition to this implementation guide, the Grouper distribution
contains javadoc (<tt>$GROUPER/doc/javadoc</tt>) that provides
some information on using the API and a list of changes from prior
releases (<tt>$GROUPER/doc/NEWS</tt>).  If this guide and the
<i>NEWS</i> file appear in conflict, <i>NEWS</i> should be considered
authoritative.  We use the symbol <i>$GROUPER</i> throughout this
document to refer to the top level of your Grouper distribution.
</p>
<p>
The best source of practical information on using the Grouper API to
can currently be found in the contributed programs
(<tt>$GROUPER/contrib/</tt>) and Grouper's test suite
(<tt>$GROUPER/java/tests/</tt>), both of which are included with
the Grouper distribution.  They exercise many functional aspects of the
API and the latter serves as a means of assessing that a Grouper
installation is working properly.  A Grouper development guide and
improved sample programs are under construction and will be available
at a later date.

<h2>2. The Groups Registry</h2>
</div>
<!-- registry_gans -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="registry_gans"/>
<h3>2.1 Groups And Namespaces</h3>
</div>
<p>
Grouper works by managing two principal types of objects: groups
and namespaces.  A group is a list of members and various attributes.
A namespace is a context in which a group or a another namespace
may be located and and named along with various attributes.  Both
groups and namespaces may have a number of different privileges
assigned to them.  From the perspective of information management
a Grouper deployment is defined by which subjects (people, applications,
groups) have what access to each namespace and group.
</p>
<p>
The Groups Registry uses a RDBMS to store information on namespaces,
groups, memberships and possibly privileges.  Grouper is
currently known to work and tested with HSQLDB, PostgreSQL and Oracle.
This is the current Grouper database schema <a href="erd.jpg">ERD</a>.

<h3>2.2 Group And Namespace Attributes</h3>
</div>
<p>
Attributes are predefined single-valued pairs that may be assigned to both
groups and namespaces.  The names of attributes are <b>case
sensitive</b> while the values are typically not.
<p>
Groups and namespaces have the following set of attributes:

<h3>2.4 Naming Examples</h3>
</div>
<p>
The <a href="#table_group_and_ns_attrs">attributes table</a> shows that groups and
namespaces have the same naming attributes (<i>stem</i>,
<i>extension</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>displayExtension</i> and
<i>displayName</i>) with the same semantics.  Groups and namespaces are
created and named within namespaces and namespaces can be arranged in
either a flat or hierarchical style as desired by the implementation
site.
</p>
<p>
Since a group must be named within a namespace, it is necessary to
create a namespace before any groups can be created. Namespaces are
currently modeled internally as groups of <i>naming</i> type.  The
following code example demonstrates the creation of a namespace and a
group within that namespace:
</p>
<pre>
  /*
   * Create a root-level namespace with the extension "uofc".
   */
  String        ns_extn   = "uofc";
  GrouperStem   ns        = GrouperStem.create(s, ns_extn);

  /*
   * Create a group with the extension "exec_council" within the "uofc"
   * namespace.  
   */
  String        grp_stem  = "uofc";
  String        grp_extn  = "exec_council";
  GrouperGroup  g         = GrouperGroup.create(s, grp_stem, grp_extn);
</pre>
<p>
A <i>hierarchy delimiter</i> is used in string representations of the names of
groups and namespaces. This delimiter is placed between every
<i>stem</i> and <i>extension</i>.  The delimiter is a ":" and this character can
not be used as part of the extension for either namespaces or groups.
</p>
<p>
Each newly created group or namespace contributes just one new element,
the <i>extension</i>, to its accumulative name.  The <i>displayName</i>
of groups and namespaces is likewise accumulative - that's why the
<i>name</i> and <i>displayName</i> attributes are system maintained
and read-only. Here are some further examples illustrating all of
the naming attributes of several namespaces and groups.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the example of the namespace and group created above,
below are the attributes values that each would have:
</p>
<p>
<table id="table" align="center" border="1" width="60%">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th colspan="2">namespace uofc</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="c" width="25%"><i>stem</i></td>
  <td class="r">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>extension</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>displayExtension</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>name</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>displayName</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table id="table" align="center" border="1" width="60%">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th colspan="2">group uofc:exec_council</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="c" width="25%"><i>stem</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>extension</i></td>
  <td class="r">exec_council</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>displayExtension</i></td>
  <td class="r">exec_council</td>

  <td class="c"><i>name</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc:exec_council</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="c"><i>displayName</i></td>
  <td class="r">uofc:exec_council</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>
If we then assign the namespace a <i>displayExtension</i> value of
"The University Of Chicago", the namespace and group will have the
following attribute values:
</p>
<p>
<table id="table" align="center" border="1" width="60%">

  <th colspan="2">namespace uofc</th>

</p>
<p>
This set of examples illuminates at least two things. First, that it
would be a good idea for implementation sites to establish conventions
for the assignment of naming attributes. An example of such is 
<a href="http://techag.uchicago.edu/idm-wg/attrValueBNF.txt">here</a>
(note that it was created before Grouper's design encompassed
<i>displayNames</i> and at that time the term <i>descriptor</i>
was used where we now say <i>extension</i>).
</p>
<p>
Second, that the names of groups, as with the titles of many types of
things, influence people's initial expectations of the meaning of
those groups. Seeing "Enterprise Information Systems staff" by itself
gives a different impression than seeing it in the context of
"Biological Sciences Division". That, in part, motivates the care taken
in the design of Grouper's <a href="#registry_privs">privilege
model</a>.
</p>
<!-- registry_naming -->
<!-- registry_privs -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="registry_privs"/>
<h3>2.5 Privileges</h3>
</div>
<p>
There are two categories of privileges in Grouper: <i>Access</i> and
<i>Naming</i>.  Access privileges determine what a subject can do
to a group. Naming privileges determine what a subject can do to a
namespace.  All Grouper API methods are subject to the Grouper
privilege model and privileges can be assigned to subjects of any type,
including groups.  See <a href="#integrate_privs">Integrating
Privileges</a> for more information on the Grouper privilege model.
</p>
<p>
The access and naming privileges are listed in the following tables:

<h2>4. Building Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
If you intend to build and test Grouper using a RDBMS other than the
default HSQLDB backend, please review the configuration sections for
the <a href="#config_db">database</a> and 
<a href="#config_subjects">subjects</a> first.
<ol>
  <li><p>Get the Java SDK.</p>
    <p>The SDK may be downloaded from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">&lt;http://java.sun.com/j2se/&gt;</a>.
    The JRE alone is not sufficient.</p></li>
  <li><p>Get Ant</p>
    <p>Ant may be downloaded from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">&lt;http://ant.apache.org&gt;</a>.</p>
    <p>Directions for installing Ant are in the unpacked distribution
    at <i>docs/manual/install.html#installing</i>. You may need to
    copy <i>tools.jar</i> from <tt>$JAVA_HOME/lib</tt> to
    <tt>$ANT_HOME/lib</tt> to get ant working properly.</p></li>
  <li>Change directory to <tt>$GROUPER</tt>.</li>
  <li><p><tt>ant build</tt></p>
    <p>This will compile Grouper and place the class files under
    the <tt>$GROUPER/build</tt> directory.</p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant db-init</tt></p>
    <p>This will create a Groups Registry in
    <tt>$GROUPER/dist/run/</tt> directory using the default
    HSQLDB RDBMS.</p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant test</tt></p>
    <p>This will compile and run the Grouper test suite to exercise the
    API and ensure that Grouper is properly configured.</p>
    <p><b>Note: Running the test suite is destructive and will
    delete all groups and memberships in the Groups Registry.  Do
    not run the test suite against production data.</b></p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant db</tt> [optional]</p>
    <p>This will launch HSQLDB's GUI database manager.  From within the
    manager you can run SQL queries against the Groups Registry.</p></li>
  <li><p><tt>ant dist</tt> [optional]</p>
    <p>This creates two .jar files within
    <tt>$GROUPER/dist/lib/</tt>.  One file contains all of the
    Grouper class files while the other contains all of the third
    party .jar files used by Grouper.  This isn't required but does
    ease <i>$CLASSPATH</i> configuration.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>5. Configuring Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
Grouper requires very little configuration by default.  In fact, if a
site is comfortable using the HSQLDB database and running all programs
that interact with the Groups Registry from the <i>$GROUPER</i>
directory, no configuration (outside of <a href="#run">setting one's
classpath</a>) is required.  The next sections will explain how to
move beyond that specific (and default) setup.
</p>
<!-- config_db -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="config_db"/>
<h3>5.1 Database</h3>
</div>
<p>
Grouper uses <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> to
persist objects in the Groups Registry.  As Hibernate uses JDBC to
speak to a RDBMS, Grouper should be able to work with your preferred
database backend provided there is a JDBC driver for it.  Grouper
is currently being tested against HSQLDB (the default), PostgreSQL
and Oracle.
</p>
<!-- config_db_hsqldb -->
<div class="subsubsection">
<a name="config_db_hsqdlb"/>
<h4>5.1.1 HSQLDB</h4>
</div>
<p>
Grouper uses HSQLDB as its default RDBMS.  The ony configuration that
may be required is to provide an absolute path to one's database by
setting <i>hibernate.connection.url</i> in
<tt>$GROUPER/conf/grouper.properties</tt>.
</p>
<!-- config_db_hsqldb -->
<!-- config_db_postgres -->
<div class="subsubsection">
<a name="config_db_postgres"/>
<h4>5.1.2 PostgreSQL</h4>
</div>
<p>
PostgreSQL is a supported Grouper backend and should only require small
configuration changes to use.  Grouper also includes a PostgreSQL
JDBC driver; see <tt>$GROUPER/java/lib/README</tt> for version
information.  To use PostgreSQL you will need to:
<ol>
  <li>Uncomment the PostgreSQL section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/hibernate.properties</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Uncomment the PostgreSQL section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/sources.xml</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Set <i>sql.type</i> to <i>postgres</i> in 
    <tt>$GROUPER/build.xml</tt></li>
</ol>
</p>
<!-- config_db_postgres -->
<!-- config_db_oracle -->
<div class="subsubsection">
<a name="config_db_oracle"/>
<h4>5.1.3 Oracle</h4>
</div>
<p>
Oracle is a supported Grouper backend and should only require small
configuration changes to use.  An Oracle JDBC driver is not currently
distributed with Grouper.  To use Oracle you will need to:
<ol>
  <li>Uncomment the Oracle section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/hibernate.properties</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Uncomment the Oracle section of 
    <tt>$GROUPER/conf/sources.xml</tt> and modify as
    appropriate.</li>
  <li>Set <i>sql.type</i> to <i>oracle</i> in 
    <tt>$GROUPER/build.xml</tt></li>
</ol>
</p>
<!-- config_db_oracle -->
<div class="subsubsection">
<a name="config_db_other"/>
<h4>5.1.4 Using Other Databases</h4>
</div>
<p>
While Grouper should work with other databases, it has not yet been
tested with them nor does it provide support for them as shipped.
To use an alternate database you will need to:
<ol>
  <li>Modify Grouper's Hibernate configuration file
    (<tt>$GROUPER/conf/hibernate.properties</tt>) to connect to
    your RDBMS</li>
  <li>Modify Grouper's Subject API configuration file
    (<tt>$GROUPER/conf/sources.xml</tt>) to connect to
    your RDBMS</li>
  <li>Create <tt>$GROUPER/sql/schema-$YOUR_DB_TYPE.sql</tt></li>
  <li>Create <tt>$GROUPER/sql/test-data-$YOUR_DB_TYPE.sql</tt></li>
  <li>Set <i>sql.type</i> to <i>$YOUR_DB_TYPE</i> in 
    <tt>$GROUPER/build.xml</tt></li>
</ol>
If you do use an alternate database that is not natively supported by
Grouper, please contact the 
<a href="https://mail.internet2.edu/wws/info/grouper-dev">grouper-dev</a> 
list with your results and schema files.

<h3>5.2 Subjects</h3>
</div>
<p>
See <a href="#integrate_subjects">Integrating Subjects</a> for more
information on subjects and the I2MI Subject API.
</p>
<p>
The configuration file for Grouper's I2MI Subject API resolver is 
<tt>$GROUPER/config/sources.xml</tt>.  The I2MI Subject API is used
to map an external IDM infrastructure to Grouper internals and can
be used to identify people, groups and applications from multiple
sources of authority.
</p>
<p>
Grouper's default configuration uses Grouper as the source of
authority for subjects of type <i>group</i> and several tables
within the Groups Registry for subjects of type <i>person</i>.  If
you wish to use additional or different sources, you will need to
adjust this file.  At this time, the javadoc provided with each
source adapter is probably the best location for configuration
information.  
</p>
<p>
Sites <b>should not</b> change the source for subjects of type
<i>group</i>.  
</p>
<!-- config_subjects -->
<!-- config_privs -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="config_privs"/>
<h3>5.3 Privileges</h3>
</div>
<p>
<tt>$GROUPER/conf/grouper.properties</tt> must be modified if a site is
using an <a href="#integrate_privs">external privilege resolver</a>.
Modify the <i>interface.access</i> or <i>interface.naming</i>
configuration parameters to reflect the class name of the external
privilege resolver that is being used.
</p>
<!-- config_privs -->
<!-- config_logging -->

<h3>5.4 Logging</h3>
</div>
<p>
Unless a site is running all programs from within <tt>$GROUPER</tt> the 
<i>log4j.appender.rfile.File</i> parameter in
<tt>$GROUPER/conf/log4j.properties</tt> should be modified to use an
absolute path to Grouper's logfile.  Other parameters may be adjusted
within this file to affect the verbosity and type of logging that
Grouper produces.
</p>

<!-- config_cache -->
<div class="subsection">

<h3>5.5 Cache</h3>
</div>
<p>
<a href="http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/">ehcache</a> is used by
Hibernate to cache objects and query results to both memory and disk.
Depending upon your usage and the size of your Groups Registry, you may
want to adjust your cache settings.  See the 
<a href="http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/">ehcache
documentation</a> for more details and then update
<tt>$GROUPER/ehcache.xml</tt> as appropriate.

<h2>6. Running Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
As Grouper is currently just a database and a Java API for exercising
that database, there is no "Groups Registry server" that needs to
be running to interact with the Groups Registry.  All that is necessary
is that one be able to connect to your configured database and that the
following items be in your classpath:
<ul>
  <li>full pathname of the <i>Grouper.jar</i> file produced by <tt>ant
    dist</tt></li>
  <li>full pathname of the <i>Grouper-lib.jar</i> file produced by
    <tt>ant dist</tt></li>
  <li>full pathname of the directory containing Grouper's configuration
    files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Integrating Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
This section is intended to demonstrate how to integrate Grouper with
your existing infrastructure and practices.  Unfortunately, because of
where Grouper is in its development process, integration information
remains sparse.
</p>
<!-- integrate_inandout -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="integrate_inandout"/>
<h3>7.1 Loaders And Provisioning Connectors</h3>
</div>
<p>
Loaders and provisioning connectors are defined in the 
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html#heading_2_Comp">components &amp; architecture section</a>
in <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html">Grouper Phase 1 Specifications</a>. 
Loaders are automation process that use the Grouper API to load and
maintain the Groups Registry from other source.  Provisioning
connectors are automation processes that use the Grouper API to
extract information from the Groups Registry in order to represent it
in other databases, directories, etc.
</p>
<p>
As this is an early release, there is as yet no real world contributed
code that has been used to get data in and out of Grouper.  However, the 
<a href="#sample">sample applications</a> discussed later in this
document could be used as a starting point.
</p>
<p>
All interactions with the Grouper API are conducted within a session
that is constrained by the privileges of the session's subject.
The default <i>GrouperSystem</i> subject may be used although it may be
preferable to assign each loader and provisioning connector a unique
subject to better meet site-specific security requirements.
</p>
<p>
When a new Grouper session is started, the API verifies the subject's
existence but <b>does not</b> authenticate the subject.  It is assumed
that sites will secure access to the Grouper API - as they do other
infrastructure services - with a combination of of host and application
platform security measures.
</p>
<p>
The Grouper API provides methods for searching the registry to select
groups to load or provision.  The search filters are provided by the
<i>GrouperQuery</i> class.  The list of available filters includes:
<ul>
  <li>specifying a namespace scope for searching within</li>
  <li>specifying a group name</li>
  <li>specifying an arbitrary group attribute</li>
  <li>specifying a time before which the group was modified</li>
  <li>specifying a time after which the group was modified</li>
  <li>specifying a time before which the group was created</li>
  <li>specifying a time after which the group was created</li>
  <li>specifying a group <i>type</i></li>
  <li>specifying whether the group has immediate or effective
    memberships, or both.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Further search capabilities are slated for later releases of Grouper.
See <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-search-00.html">Grouper API Search &amp; Browse Capabilities</a>
for details.
</p>
<p>
Grouper currently has no way to limit the number of objects returned by a
search.  Search result limits will be added in a future release.
</p>
<!-- integrate_inandout -->
<!-- integrate_subjects -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="integrate_subjects"/>
<h3>7.2 Subjects</h3>
</div>
<p>
Most often the members of your groups will be people and other groups
but they might also be of any other type (applications or computers,
for example) for which you now or eventually will manage identities.
By using the I2MI Subject API as a resolver service, Grouper allows
sites to use multiple external IDM sources of authority to identify
group members.
</p>
<p>
Identifiers and their management can get complicated. They can be
revoked or not, re-assigned or not, lucent or opaque, etc. Depending on
such characteristics, a given identifier might be a good or bad choice
to use in the context of managing the identified subject's group
memberships.
</p>
<p>
For example, a username is often lucent - easily remembered by the
person to whom it is associated. But it may also be revokable, meaning
that it no longer refers to that person (perhaps they have a new one),
or even re-assignable, meaning that it might refer to some other person
at a later time. If a username is used to record membership, username
changes must trigger corresponding membership changes. A username is
better suited to authentication than it is to indicating membership.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, an opaque registryID (machine, not human, readable)
that never changes is great for membership, but lousy for
authentication - it might not even be known by the person to whom
it is associated. How would I identify myself to Grouper if I wished to
opt-in to a list or manage a group?
</p>
<p>
Grouper accommodates subject identifier issues in two ways. First, it
maintains guids for every subject and group within the Groups
Registry.  These are never exposed by the API, but are associated
with externally supplied subject identifiers within the Groups Registry.
This approach allows the identifier associated with a given subject
to be changed without any need to change actual memberships (although
the supporting method is not yet available via the Grouper API).
</p>
<p>
Second, by incorporating the Subject API Grouper is able to lookup
subjects that are presented with an identifier in one namespace and
obtain identifiers in other namespaces for that subject.  That means
that it can translate a username into a registryID and vice-versa,
for example. So, when a user authenticates to an application using
the Grouper API, that application can use the Subject API to fetch
an identifier for that person chosen by the site for use in
memberships. Similarly, when a membership in the Groups Registry
is to be expressed elsewhere, the identifier used for group members
can be translated by a provisioning connector by use of the Subject
API into one that is suitable in the provisioned context.
</p>
<p>
While Grouper currently only includes support for two sources of
authority for subject information, sites could write a source adapter
class that would hit their LDAP directory or Person Registry directly
to validate that a <i>subjectID</i> is in fact one that is valid
for a group management operation.  It is expected that the I2MI Subject
API will include a LDAP source adapter in the near future.
</p>
<!-- integrate_subjects_resolve -->
<!-- integrate_privs -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="integrate_privs"/>
<h3>7.3 Privileges</h3>
</div>
<p>
The Grouper API provides and uses abstracted interfaces
(<i>GrouperAccess</i> and <i>GrouperNaming</i>) to access and
manage the Access and Naming privileges.  This design permits
implementation sites to replace Grouper's default implementation
of either or both of these interfaces if they desire to integrate
with an already existing external privilege management system.  It
is anticipated that Grouper will provide support for integrating
with a
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/signet/">Signet</a> 
Privilege Registry in the future.
</p>
<p>
The default implementations of the Access and Naming privileges that
are used by Grouper uses group list values to represent assigned
privileges.  Because privileges are modeled as list values in these
implementations one is able to take advantage of Grouper's list
management capabilities.  In particular, this means that one can use
subgroups to provide for the interitance of privileges.  In addition,
one will be able to take advantage of group math and aging tasks to
provide an even richer privilege management environment.
</p>
<p>
If a site desires to replace one or both of the default privilege
implementations, see the <i>GrouperAccess</i> and <i>GrouperNaming</i>
javadoc for information on the interface that must be implemented.  In
addition, the <i>interface.access</i> and <i>interface.naming</i>
configuration parameters in <tt>$GROUPER/conf/grouper.properties</tt>
will need to be adjusted to reflect the privilege implementation being
used.
</p>
<!-- integrate_privs_dgmc -->
<div class="subsubsection">
<a name="integrate_privs_dgmc"/>
<h4>7.3.1 Using Privileges To Distribute Group Management
Capabilities</h4>
</div>
<p>
One of the leading reasons why there is interest in Grouper is that
many sites recognize a need to involve many sources of authority in
managing resource access, distribution lists and application
customization - the types of needs which groups help to satisfy.
Grouper's privilege model supports five ways to distribute
management of groups.
<ol>
  <li>Create a group and assign someone <i>UPDATE</i> privilege to
    it.  This delegates the ability to maintain the group's
    membership.</li>
  <li>Create a group and assign someone <i>ADMIN</i> privilege to it.
    This delegates the ability to manage who can maintain the group's
    membership as well as manage all access to the group.</li>
  <li>Create a namespace and assign someone <i>CREATE</i> privilege
    to it. This delegates the ability to preside over the collection
    of all groups they create in that namespace.</li>
  <li>Create a namespace and assign someone <i>STEM</i> privilege
    to it.  They can rule over an entire hierarchy of namespaces and
    groups, all sharing a common root namespace.</li>
  <li>Create a group and assign <i>OPTIN</i> and/or <i>OPTOUT</i>
    privilege to other groups. Subjects belonging to those other
    groups are entitled to manage their own membership in the
    group.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
An example of an actual scenario for delegation of group management to
solve an access control problem can be found in
<a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/%7Etbarton/camp-200411/20041117-authz.ppt">&lt;http://home.uchicago.edu/~tbarton/camp -200411/20041117-authz.ppt</a>.

<h2>8. Extending Grouper</h2>
</div>
<p>
Grouper does currently provide some ability for sites to extend
Grouper's default behavior and types to better fit local needs.
Currently <a href="#extend_group_types">group types</a> (including
attributes and lists) and <a href="#extend_privs">privileges</a>
may be extended with varying degrees of difficulty.
</p>
<!-- extend_group_types -->
<div class="subsection">
<a name="extend_group_types"/>
<h3>8.1 Group Types</h3>
</div>
<p>
To support some of the 
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-sage-scenarios-00.html">use cases</a>
identified by MACE-Dir-Groups working group members, Grouper was
designed from the start to enable implementation sites to extend the
set of attributes and lists available to be associated with groups.
This was done by declaring attributes, lists, and their properties in
tables within the Groups Registry rather than having them represented
as static schematic elements of that database. Sets of attributes and
lists are packaged into group types.  This is similar to how schemas
for LDAP directories are managed and extended: LDAP attributes are
packaged into object classes, and each LDAP entry can have a set
of object classes associated with it, allowing different entries
to serve different purposes.  
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, at this time Grouper only allows a single group type to
be assigned to a group.  Thus, if you are extending the Groups Registry
by creating new group types you will currently need to first duplicate
the definition of the <i>base</i> group type and then add any
additional attributes and lists that you may desire.  Grouper ships
with one custom group type: <i>naming</i>.  This type is used
internally to model namespaces.
</p>
<p>
Although it is not currently possible  to extend Grouper's supported
group types, attributes and lists with the API, sites can create
new group types, attributes and lists.  To adjust the schema  you will
need to manually alter the <i>grouper_type</i>, <i>grouper_typeDef</i>
and <i>grouper_field</i> tables within the Groups Registry to
determine the set of attributes and lists that are associated with
an extended group type.  The <tt>$GROUPER/sql/init.sql</tt> file
may provide some guidance on how to update those tables with your
desired extensions.

<h3>8.2 Privileges</h3>
</div>
<p>
Although it is not currently possible to extend Grouper's privilege
model with the API, sites that extend the set of <a href="#extend_group_types">attributes
and lists</a> in their deployment can declare which privileges are
needed to read and write each attribute and list.  To adjust the schema
you will need to manually alter the <i>grouper_field</i> table within
the Groups Registry.  The <tt>$GROUPER/sql/init.sql</tt> file may
provide some guidance on how to update this table with your desired
additions.

<h2>9. Sample Applications</h2>
</div>

larger and better selection of sample programs should be available in
the near future.

<h3>9.1 Subject Loader: csv2subject</h3>
</div>
<p>
The default source for <i>person</i> subjects is within the Groups
Registry itself.  <i>csv2subject</i> is a simple program for populating
the appropriate tables with subject information from a .csv input file.
See <a href="#config_subjects">Configuring Subjects</a> and 
<a href="#integrate_subjects">Integrating Subjects</a> for more
information on subjects.
<p>
<i>csv2subject</i> is located in <tt>$GROUPER/contrib/load/csv2subject</tt>.  
This program reads in a .csv file containing <i>subjectIDs</i> and
