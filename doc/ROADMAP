# Grouper 0.9

## @next actions
* Profiling
* Cache access and naming privs
* Membership: cache getGroup()
* Membership: cache getStem()
* InternalSourceAdapter: don't recreate ALL and ROOT everytime
* Configurable options for logging adding/granting/deleting/revoking
  immediate and effective memberships and privs
* Throw _SchemaException_ on all things that take a _Privilege_ or _Field_ as argument
* GrouperAttribute: attribute methods should throw ANFE + SE
* Methods that look like they need some love
  * GrouperAccessAdapter: getPrivs()
  * GrouperNamingAdapter: getPrivs()
  * GrouperNamingAdapter: hasPriv() should take ALL into account
* Review RTEs in _GrouperAccessAdapter_ and _GrouperNamingAdapter_

## @later
* Event logging
  * Clean up returned error messages when exceptions thrown
* Replace contrib items with updated cdg

## @maybe
* PrivilegeResolver: isRoot and wheel group
* Membership: map via_id to Group (will factors break this?)
* GrouperSessionFinder: make internal root sessions !hibernated
* Cache subjects
* GrouperSession: automatic proxying
  * GroupFinder.findByName() is candidate
  * GroupFinder.findByUuid() is candidate
* FieldFinder: cache findAll()
* Group: cache attributes

## @testing
* _AccessPrivilege_ and _NamingPrivilege_ objects
* invalid group + stem names
* empty config options for granting all, wheel group, interfaces, etc
* privs with groups
* field validation: fields (attrs, lists, naming and access)
* Test create + modify subject when !root
* renaming "root" subject?  this probably shouldn't be allowed.
* review old memberof tests 
* Review old _*.todo_ test classes (and then remove)
* concurrence, persistence and versioning
* Test with Pg and Oracle and review generated SQL
  * ship with generated schema?
* deletion (group + mship + priv) in _TestMemberOf_
* What happens when you delete a group and then attempt to perform
  further operations on it?
* can i delete TestGrouperAccess* and TestGrouperNaming* tests?

## @document
* What triggers modified updates?
* record where each *Finder method is called from
* wheel group
* ALL toggles
* query api javadoc
* _doc/CHANGES_
  * public api
  * query api
  * ALL subject
  * wheel group
* Attempt to normalize API debug logging
  * Include method names
  * Use constants

## DRY
* Member: isMember(), isImmediateMember() and isEffectiveMember()
* Membership: addImmediateMembership()
* Membership: delImmediateMembership()
* Membership: deleteAllField()
* Membership: _membershipsToDelete()
* Privilege: canWriteField()

## Aesthetics
* Group: _deleteAttribute() naming attr handling
* GrouperSubject: _addAttr() attr + value validation
* Member: toGroup()
* PrivilegeResolver: canVIEW()
* Stem: addChildGroup() updates modify* attrs of child
* Stem: addChildStem() updates modify* attrs of child
* Stem: constructName()
* StemFinder: isChild()
* Test helper methods
