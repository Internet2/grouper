# Grouper 0.9

## Next Actions
* ALL toggle switches 
* Finish refactoring _MembershipFinder_ to apply READ + VIEW filtering
* Profiling and benchmarking
  * Areas that probably need tweaking
    * Privilege cache(s)
    * Subject cache(s)
    * Attribute cache
    * List cache
  * Lazy + batch collection fetching
* Review files and add TODO items to this list
* Throw _SchemaException_ on all things that take a _Privilege_ or _Field_ as argument
* Review generated SQL
  * Including my twisty column names
  * Add 
    * create member + time to memberships 
    * factor type
    * status + ttl?
* Configurability
  * Configurable options for logging adding/granting/deleting/revoking
    immediate and effective memberships and privs
  * What triggers a "modified" update?
    * possibly make configurable to avoid bikeshedding?
* Test field validation
  * Attributes
  * Lists
  * Naming privs
  * Access privs
* Test create + modify subject when !root
* Test _AccessPrivilege_ and _NamingPrivilege_ objects

## Later - pre-code freeze
* Test
  * Review old _*.todo_ test classes (and then remove)
  * Test concurrence and persistence  
    * Versioning
  * Test with Pg and Oracle and review generated SQL
    * ship with generated schema?
  * deletion (group + mship + priv) in _TestMemberOf_
  * What happens when you delete a group and then attempt to perform
    further operations on it?
  * renaming "root" subject?  this probably shouldn't be allowed.
* Review thrown exceptions, especially runtime exceptions
  * Only public methods should adjust the exception messages
* General code review
  * more complete session validation
* Bugs
  * Minor
    * modify* attrs set on groups and stems at creation due to granting
      of privs to creator
    * _Membership_ child_memberships mapping


## Later - post-code freeze
* Event logging
* record where each *Finder method is called from
* Replace contrib items with updated cdg
* Document
  * wheel group
  * ALL subject toggle switches
  * query api javadoc
  * caching
    * privileges
    * subjects
  * _doc/CHANGES_
    * public api
    * query api
    * ALL subject
    * wheel group
* Attempt to normalize API debug logging
  * Include method names
  * Use constants

## Probably 1.0
* Additional query filters
* Custom group types
  * Custom group attributes
    * setting, unsetting, nullable, etc
  * Custom group lists
    * add to group subjects
    * removing upon group deletion
