<h2>Grouper 0.5.5 Implementation Guide</h2>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>
This guide will help you to build and operate Grouper 0.5.5. As this is
the initial release and there is as yet no previous experience with
Grouper implementation, even by its developers, the initial form of
this guide is far from a comprehensive treatment of the topic. Our
strategy is to bootstrap the documentation process by providing enough
information to enable early adopters to get going and subsequently
contribute to the enhancement of this document by their experiences.
</p>
<p>
Along with obtaining Grouper 0.5.5 (see the MACE-Dir-Groups website
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups">&lt;http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/&gt;</a>
for instructions), adopters should join the grouper-users at internet2
dot edu and possibly the grouper-dev at internet2 dot edu mailists
for collective self-help with implementation and to discuss ideas
for further development of Grouper.  Instructions for joining these
lists are also on the MACE-Dir-Groups website.

<h3>1. Introduction To Grouper 0.5.5</h3>
</div>
<p>
Grouper 0.5.5 provides an API supporting basic groups management
capabilities - creation, update, and removal of groups from a Groups
Registry, subgroups, limited querying capabilities, and logging. It
also includes sample programs illustrating how to load data into and
extract data from the Groups Registry.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html">Grouper Phase 1 Specifications</a>
the <a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/draft-internet2-mace-dir-grouper-phase1-specs-04.html#heading_2_Comp">components &amp; architecture section</a>
depicts the major components of Grouper and their relation to
elements of an implementation site's existing identity management
infrastructure. Those components are an API, a relational database
called the Groups Registry, a set of aging tasks, and one or more
user interfaces for managing groups. Grouper 0.5.5 is comprised of
an alpha release of the API and procedures to create the Groups
Registry within an HSQLDB database. The user interface, aging tasks,
and some substantial elements of API functionality are slated for
future release according to the following table.

<p>
In section 2 of this document we'll start by describing how to
build, configure, and install the API and Groups Registry. We'll
lay out Grouper's information and privilege models in section 3 and
consider how they may integrate with existing identifier namespaces and
extend existing identity management practices. In section 4 we'll
consider, at a functional level, how Grouper may be made to articulate
with an existing infrastructure.
</p
<p>
In addition to this Implementation Guide, the Grouper 0.5.5 distribution
contains javadoc and other germinal guides for developers (i.e., good
intention outweighs substance at the moment). All of these are found in
the doc/ directory of the distribution, which also contains a file
called NEWS that lists features in 0.5.5, those that are slated for a
future release, and known problems with 0.5.5. If this document and the
NEWS file appear to be in conflict on any point, the NEWS file should
be considered authoritative.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the best source of API usage guidelines for developers at the
moment is the set of contributed programs and the suite of test
programs included with the distribution. They exercise many functional
aspects of the API, and the latter serve as the benchmark by which to
assess that a Grouper installation is working properly.
</p>
<p>
"Grouper Phase 1 Specifications" contains an Entity Relationship
Diagram for an early form of the Groups Registry schema. An ERD of the
schema deployed in Grouper 0.5.5 can be found 
<a href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/docs/groupsRegERD4.4.gif">here</a>.
