## Grouper 1.0

### Bugs
* Privileges are not applied to `Composite` objects, including getters
* Logging of composite membership changes
* Membership UUIDs can change, especially in effective mships and
  possibly when updating composites
** Clean up `Composite.update()` once fixed
** Clean up `Membership.getPersistent()` once fixed

### Next Actions
* CODE      delete custom group types
* CODE      Fix some issues reported by FindBugs, PMD and CPD
* TEST      basic and preliminary concurrency testing (i expect to find many bugs)
* CODE      add `Group.getTypes()` that will return all types that the
  group has, including base but excluding internal types
* CODE      add `Group.getRemovableTypes()` that will return all types
  that can be removed from the group
* CONTRIB   complete cdg 1.0 feature list
* REVIEW    review all RTEs
* REVIEW    FIXMEs
* REVIEW    TODOs

### Later || Maybe
* CODE      Migrate error messages to *E*
* CODE      Migrate messages to *M*
* CODE      Switch to *IllegalArgumentException* and *NullArgumentException*
* DOCUMENT  add `@since` to javadoc (just diff `doc/API`? for now
  since i've been failing to add this?)
* PACKAGING create binary-and-source distributions
* CODE      improved API support for XML import+export
* CODE      class to verify that setup is functional
** find the root stem, exercise subject api, hibernate dialect + driver class, etc
* CODE      delete _HibernateSubject_ objects
* CODE      modify _HibernateSubject_ objects
* CODE      start populating `Membership` creator
* CODE      privilege query filters
* REFACTOR  internal root sessions should not need to go through hibernate
* REFACTOR  privilege checking and caching
** `NamingResolver`
** `AccessResolver`
