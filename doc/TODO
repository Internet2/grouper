# Grouper 0.9

## Post-Code Freeze

* update impl guide
  * note what adjusts modified time
  * wheel group
  * ALL + toggles
  * contrib
* javadoc
  * especially query api javadoc  

* Profile
  * Gary: "By using GrouperAll instead of qsuob:all for assigning 'global'
    privs fewer effective grants are required, but if I grant access
    privs to qsuob:all_students which has 6 groups of 12 subjects as
    immediate members, assignment is still quite slow."
    * Metrics
    * Switch from `find()` to `iterate()`
    * Cache queries
* Logging
  * _ErrorLog_
  * _DebugLog_
* Config options for cache flushing (and do I flush on revoke all?)
* EXPLAIN sql queries
* Consolidate _Membership_ index (or will Oracle kvetch about that one
  as well?)
* _Membership_: Set via to null on immediate members
* _Membership_: Map child memberships to enable batch fetching

# Future

## Features
* Filter by specific stem-attributes
* XML Import|Export (XStream?)

## Internals
* Stem: _addChildGroup()_ and _addChildStems()_ should take an optional
  Properties arg that would override configuration defaults
* Rework _PrivilegeCache_ so that I can expire individual entries
  instead of the full cache

## DRY
* Member: isMember(), isImmediateMember() and isEffectiveMember()
* Membership: addImmediateMembership()
* Membership: delImmediateMembership()
* Membership: deleteAllField()
* Privilege: canWriteField()
* GrouperSession: automatic proxying
  * GroupFinder.findByName() is candidate
  * GroupFinder.findByUuid() is candidate

## Testing
* deletion (group + mship + priv) in _TestMemberOf_
* privs with members of groups-with-granted-privs
* concurrence, persistence and versioning
* What happens when you delete a group and then attempt to perform
  further operations on it?
* can i delete TestGrouperAccess* and TestGrouperNaming* tests?

## Aesthetics
* FieldFinder: cache findAll()
* Group: _deleteAttribute() naming attr handling
* GrouperSubject: _addAttr() attr + value validation
* Member: toGroup()
* PrivilegeResolver: canVIEW()
* Stem: addChildGroup() updates modify* attrs of child
* Stem: addChildStem() updates modify* attrs of child
* Stem: constructName()
* StemFinder: isChild()
* Test helper methods

## Maybe
* Membership: map via_id to Group.  Factors may break this.
* Cache subjects
* Removal of members that are no longer in use (#196)
* Search by the set of groups or namespaces created or modified
  by a specified subject [S&B#12]
* Search by the set of groups to which a given subject is an immediate 
  member can be listed [S&B#9]
* Search by the set of groups to which a given subject is an effective 
  member can be listed [S&B#10]
* Paged search results
* Group Hierarchy depth restrictions
* Improved, expanded and more consistent logging policy (#226)
* Search limits
