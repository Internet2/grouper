## Grouper 1.0

### Bugs
* Privileges are not applied to Composites
* Logging of composite membership changes

### Next Actions
* code: union composites (sync)
* admin: merge GROUPER_1_0_TAKE2 back into HEAD
* code: complement composites (sync)
* code: intersection composites (sync)
* code: start populating membership creator
* code: add `Group.canReadField(f)`
* code: add `Group.canWriteField(f)`
* code: privilege query filters
* code: class to verify that setup is functional
** find the root stem, exercise subject api, hibernate dialect + driver class, etc
* code: non-hibernated root sessions (cleanup)
* test: basic concurrency testing (i expect to find many bugs)
* code: delete custom group types
* code: internalize cache management code?
* code: add ??? `Member.canAdmin(group)` ???
* code: add ??? `Member.canCreate(stem)` ???
* code: add ??? `Member.canOptin(group)` ???
* code: add ??? `Member.canOptout(group)` ???
* code: add ??? `Member.canRead(group)` ???
* code: add ??? `Member.canStem(stem)` ???
* code: add ??? `Member.canUpdate(group)` ???
* code: add ??? `Member.canView(group)` ???
* code: privilege cleanup - `NamingResolver`
* code: privilege cleanup - `AccessResolver`
* code: privilege cleanup - Hibernate-backed `PrivilegeCache`
* code: add `Group.canReadField(f, subj)`
* code: add `Group.canWriteField(f, subj)`
* code: add `Group.getTypes()` that will return all types that the
  group has, including base but excluding internal types
* code: add `Group.getRemovableTypes()` that will return all types
  that can be removed from the group
* code: remove (all|most) RTEs
* code: toString cleanup

### Maybe
* code: API support for XML import+export
* code: either remove status-related code or else think it out more thoroughly
* code: `XmlLog`
* code: `ErrorLog`
* code: `DebugLog`
* Daemon Support
** code: add daemon (singleton?)
** code: start+stop daemon via api
** code: embed hsqldb within daemon 
*** admin: update to latest hsqldb
*** code: do not stop hsqldb if using non-embedded db
** MAYBE code: add registry integrity thread to daemon
** code: add getting-and-setting sync mode to sessions
** code: add member (async)
** code: delete member (async)
** code: grant access privilege (async)
** code: revoke access privilege (async)
** code: grant naming privilege (async)
** code: revoke naming privilege (async)
** code: add union composite member (async)
** code: delete union composite member (async)
** code: add complement composite member (async)
** code: delete complement composite member (async)
** code: add intersection composite member (async)
** code: delete intersection composite member (async)
** test: concurrency, deletion and async mods
** code: make thread sleep times (invisibly?) configurable
* code: `Owner`-related cleanup
* packaging: create binary-and-source distributions
* code: unhibernate `GrouperSession`
* code: enable batch fetching of `Membership` objects
* code: order `Membership` queries by depth
* code: add caching support to `SubjectFinder` methods that query by source
* code: Don't assign `GrouperSystem` privileges
* document: add `@since` to javadoc
* library: update [jug](http://jug.safehaus.org/)
* code: Deprecate `Membership.getViaGroup()`
