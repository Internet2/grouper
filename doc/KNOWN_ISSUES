## Effective Membership Heisenbug

Moving the effective membership modification calculations into
GrouperDaemon introduced a Heisenbug that can intermittently affect
using groups as members.  Unfortunately, the failures are not
consistent and I have not yet been able to create a reliable test to
identify it.  I intend to do so before 1.0 is released.

## Effective Membership Performance

As the number of memberships in your Groups Registry grows, Grouper's
performance whenever adding or removing a membership will degrade.
This is especially true when the groups involved have large numbers of
members or subgroup memberships.

NOTE: This is presumably now a non-issue now that effective membership
modification calculations have been pushed into another process.  Until
I confirm that, however, I'll leave this here.

## Propogation of _displayName_ changes

If you have a parent stem and one-or-more child stems or groups loaded
within a session and change the _displayExtension_ of the parent stem,
the children will have their _displayName_ updated within the registry
but those changes will not be reflected in your already loaded group
and stem objects.
