### Next Actions
* CODE      Refactor privilege caching
    * `PrivilegeCacheEntry`
    * `PrivilegeCache` interface
        * `get(Owner, Subject, Privilege)`
        * `has(Owner, Subject, Privilege)`
        * `put(Owner, Subject, Privilege, boolean)`
        * `removeAll()`
        * `remove(Owner)`
        * `remove(Subject)`
        * `remove(Privilege)`
        * abstract `BasePrivilegeCache` implements `PrivilegeCache`
            * Attach to session
        * `NullPrivilegeCache` extends `BasePrivilegeCache`
            * no caching
        * `SimplePrivilegeCache` extends `BasePrivilegeCache`  
            * empty caches whenever a priv or mship change is made?
                * this is basically just a more thorough version of whate we
                  have now
        * `LessSimplePrivilegeCache` extends `SimplePrivilegeCache`
            * a hopefully smarter version of the above
            * use the `remove()` methods to try and be selective about what is
              removed from the cache upon mods             
* CODE      Continue refactoring privilege resolution
    * `RootPrivilegeResolver` extends `PrivilegeResolver`
        * Try to isolate all needs-to-be-root and proxy-as-root code *within*
          this class
        * Should I attach a transient root session within each session?
            * Should caches be shared?
        * Include wheel checks here.  If wheel group enabled:
            * Get group
            * Check if modified since last check
                * If yes: flush? 
            * Return result
* TEST      use of wheel group
* CODE      Populate *Membership* creation attributes
* CODE      *MembershipCreatedAfter* query filter
* CODE      *MembershipCreatedBefore* query filter
* CODE      have xml* default properties + optional override properties
* CODE      improved xml* integration (including logging)
* CODE      *HibernateSubject* should not throw *HibernateException*s
* CODE      *GroupFinder.findByAttribute(s, attr, val)* [GCODE#14]
* CODE      refactor *SubjectCache*
* CODE      Refactor query cache configuration.  Add interface? Config toggle?
* DOC       Migrate impl guide to wiki and export upon release

### Maybe
* CODE      Migrate error messages to *E*
* CODE      Migrate messages to *M*
* CODE      Use `SetUtils` for group math
* CODE      checksum .hbm.xml files to try and ensure i keep schema version accurate
* CODE      check for *Settings* (and version if it exists) when calling db-init
* REFACTOR  privilege checking and caching
    * *NamingResolver*
    * *AccessResolver*
* CODE      change query parameter setting in *MembershipFinder*
* CODE      Fix some issues reported by FindBugs, PMD and CPD
* CODE      class to verify that setup is functional
    * find the root stem, exercise subject api, hibernate dialect + driver class, etc
