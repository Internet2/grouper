gsh provides a command line interface to Grouper. Many operations which were previously invoked using Ant or specialised scripts are now invoked from gsh. 

Information on command line arguments to gsh can be found by by running gsh with the -h option:

Windows type: gsh -h
*nix type: ./gsh.sh -h

Note the -initEnv option for adding gsh to the path so you can run it from anywhere.

gsh provides an interactive shell. See https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/GrouperWG/v1.4.0+GrouperShell+(gsh) for details.
