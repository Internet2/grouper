  * "lib"
    Third-party jar files included with Grouper are partitioned as described
	below.
    * "README.txt"
      Information on all of the jar files in the "GROUPER_HOME/lib" directory.

       * "ant-contrib.jar"
          Used by the Grouper Ant build script (build.xml)
    * "custom"
       Place jar files for your JDBC driver, custom Source adapters etc here
	   to make them available to Grouper
    * "grouper"
       Third-party jar files included with Grouper and required at run time
   * "jdbcSamples"
       Third-party JDBC drivers for databases known to work with Grouper.
	   Copy the appropriate jar file for your database to the "custom" 
	   directory
    * "test"
       * "junit.jar"
	      Required to run the Grouper unit tests

    * "grouper"
      Grouper API source.
    * "test"
      Grouper API test source.
	  
When you use Grouper it will create a "ddlScripts" directory, where any 
schema and data SQL manipulation scripts are generated.

By default Grouper will also create a "logs" directory, however, you can
configure, by editing log4j.properties, where you want log files to be
written.


## 3. Building Grouper (not necessary if using the binary release)

    % ant dist

This will compile the Grouper API source, generate several configuration
files, and create "GROUPER_HOME/dist/lib/grouper.jar"

## 4.a Starting The Database

If you are using the built-in hsqldb database to get started, you need to
start the hsqldb server (since hsqldb in file mode does not work well).

Run from the GROUPER_HOME directory:

    % java -cp lib/jdbcSamples/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database.0 file:grouper -dbname.0 grouper

Note, you either need to run that command in the background, or use a terminal window that will wait for the server to exit.

If you want to start the hsql database manager, run this command in a new terminal:
 
    % java -cp lib/jdbcSamples/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager -url jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/grouper
    

## 4.b Initializing The Database

    % bin/gsh.sh -registry -runscript

This generates a DDL appropriate for the database configured in
"GROUPER_HOME/conf/grouper.hibernate.properties" and applies it to the
database.  It also initializes default data in some tables (e.g. the root stem in grouper_stems)

To make sure it ran completely, run:

    % bin/gsh.sh -registry -check

You will see output: NOTE: database table/object structure (ddl) is up to date

## 5. Testing Grouper

    % bin/gsh.sh -test -all

This adds some test subjects to the Groups Registry and then runs the
Grouper test suite.  This is a *destructive* action and will destroy
any data within the configured database.

A "JDBCSourceAdapter" (id=jdbc) for subjects must be configured in
"GROUPER_HOME/conf/sources.xml" for the test suite to complete successfully.


## 6. Using Grouper

Review configuration files first.

Starting with v1.4.0 a number of Grouper utilities/extensions are now invoked
using bin/gsh.sh (or bin\gsh.bat) rather than Ant. Type:
  bin/gsh.sh -h
for more information, including how to add "gsh" to your path.

You can bootstrap arbitrary code which uses the Grouper API
by placing your code in a jar file (along with any other jar files 
not provided with Grouper)  in the "GROUPER_HOME/lib/custom" 
directory and invoking gsh i.e
  bin/gsh.sh -main <full class name> [args...]

otherwise you need to have the following items in your CLASSPATH to use Grouper:
* "GROUPER_HOME/dist/lib/grouper.jar" or the "GROUPER_HOME/build/grouper"
  directory.
* all of the jar files in the
  "GROUPER_HOME/lib/grouper" directory.
* any jar files (including your JDBC database driver) in the
  "GROUPER_HOME/lib/custom" directory.
* The "GROUPER_HOME/conf" directory.


## 7. Building API Documentation (not necessary if using the binary release)

  % ant javadoc

This will build the javadoc(1) document.


## 8. Getting Grouper

Grouper releases are available from Grouper's Internet2 Wiki:
  <https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/GrouperWG/Software+Download>

Read-only anonymous access to the Grouper CVS repository is now
available.  To perform a CVS checkout, run the following commands.
When prompted for a password, hit enter.

    % cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.internet2.edu:/home/cvs/i2mi login
    % cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.internet2.edu:/home/cvs/i2mi co grouper
