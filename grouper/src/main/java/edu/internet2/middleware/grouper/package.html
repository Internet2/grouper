<p>The I2MI Grouper project is an open source toolkit for managing groups.</p>

<h3>Grouper API Overview</h3>
<p>
While there are many public classes within the Grouper API the majority of its
functionality can be found in a small subset of its classes.  The most important
classes to familiarize yourself with are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="./Group.html">Group</a></p>
    <p>As evident by its name, Grouper is all about managing groups.
    Groups are objects that may have attributes, memberships and
    privileges assigned to them.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="./Stem.html">Stem</a></p>
    <p>Stems are namespaces within which groups are located.  They
    make it possible to delegate authority within the Groups
    Registry.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/Grouper/Subject+API">Subject</a></p>
    <p>This class is actually external to Grouper and is being
    developed by both the Grouper and Signet projects.  It provides
    an IdM abstraction that allows an application to refer to
    entities of any type (people, groups, applications, etc.) without
    needing to be aware of how those entities are accessed or stored.
    See the
    <a href="https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/Grouper/Subject+API">Subject API</a> 
    page at the Grouper wiki for more information on the Subject API.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="./SubjectFinder.html">SubjectFinder</a></p>
    <p>This is a class that abstracts finding subjects.  With it
    you can query one-or-more subject repositories in order to
    retrieve subjects for use within other Grouper API operations.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="./Member.html">Member</a></p>
    <p>Members are strictly mappings of subjects to persistent
    identifiers for those subjects within Grouper.  While many API
    operations require that a <code>Subject</code> be passed as a
    parameter, internally Grouper works on those subjects
    as <code>Member</code> objects.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="./Membership.html">Membership</a></p>
    <p>This class maps how all list values (memberships) are stored
    within the Groups Registry.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="./GrouperSession.html">GrouperSession</a></p>
    <p>This class provides an operational and security context for
    performing operations within the Grouper API.  With the exception
    of <code>SubjectFinder</code> almost <b>all</b> other API
    operations require a valid session context to operate within.
    A subject is associated with each session and the privileges
    of that subject determine what API operations can be performed
    within the session context.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a small - but growing - selection of 
<a href="./eg/package-summary.html">API usage examples</a>.
</p>
<p>This package has the major grouper javabeans (generally mapped to the DB
via hibernate), along with "Finders" which are static methods to help query
for the beans.</p>
