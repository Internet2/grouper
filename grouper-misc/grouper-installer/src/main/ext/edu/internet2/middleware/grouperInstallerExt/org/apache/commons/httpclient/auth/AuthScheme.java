 * <p>
 * This interface represents an abstract challenge-response oriented

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An authentication scheme should be able to support the following
 * functions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Parse and process the challenge sent by the targer server
 *       in response to request for a protected resource
 *   <li>Provide its textual designation
 *   <li>Provide its parameters, if available
 *   <li>Provide the realm this authentication scheme is applicable to,
 *       if available
 *   <li>Generate authorization string for the given set of credentials,
 *       request method and URI as specificed in the HTTP request line
 *       in response to the actual authorization challenge
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Authentication schemes may ignore method name and URI parameters
 * if they are not relevant for the given authentication mechanism
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Authentication schemes may be stateful involving a series of 
 * challenge-response exchanges
