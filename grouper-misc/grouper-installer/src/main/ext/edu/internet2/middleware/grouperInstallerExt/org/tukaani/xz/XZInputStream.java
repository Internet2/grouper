/**
 * Decompresses a .xz file in streamed mode (no seeking).
 * <p>
 * Use this to decompress regular standalone .xz files. This reads from
 * its input stream until the end of the input or until an error occurs.
 * This supports decompressing concatenated .xz files.
 *
 * <h4>Typical use cases</h4>
 * <p>
 * Getting an input stream to decompress a .xz file:
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 * InputStream infile = new FileInputStream("foo.xz");
 * XZInputStream inxz = new XZInputStream(infile);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * It's important to keep in mind that decompressor memory usage depends
 * on the settings used to compress the file. The worst-case memory usage
 * of XZInputStream is currently 1.5&nbsp;GiB. Still, very few files will
 * require more than about 65&nbsp;MiB because that's how much decompressing
 * a file created with the highest preset level will need, and only a few
 * people use settings other than the predefined presets.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to specify a memory usage limit for
 * <code>XZInputStream</code>. If decompression requires more memory than
 * the specified limit, MemoryLimitException will be thrown when reading
 * from the stream. For example, the following sets the memory usage limit
 * to 100&nbsp;MiB:
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 * InputStream infile = new FileInputStream("foo.xz");
 * XZInputStream inxz = new XZInputStream(infile, 100 * 1024);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h4>When uncompressed size is known beforehand</h4>
 * <p>
 * If you are decompressing complete files and your application knows
 * exactly how much uncompressed data there should be, it is good to try
 * reading one more byte by calling <code>read()</code> and checking
 * that it returns <code>-1</code>. This way the decompressor will parse the
 * file footers and verify the integrity checks, giving the caller more
 * confidence that the uncompressed data is valid. (This advice seems to
 * apply to
 * {@link java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream} too.)
