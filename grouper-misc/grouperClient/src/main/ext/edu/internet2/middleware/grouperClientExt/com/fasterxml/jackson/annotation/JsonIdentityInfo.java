/**
 * Annotation used for indicating that values of annotated type
 * or property should be serializing so that instances either
 * contain additional object identifier (in addition actual object
 * properties), or as a reference that consists of an object id
 * that refers to a full serialization. In practice this is done
 * by serializing the first instance as full object and object
 * identity, and other references to the object as reference values.
 *<p>
 * There are two main approaches to generating object identifier:
 * either using a generator (either one of standard ones, or a custom
 * generator), or using a value of a property. The latter case is
 * indicated by using a placeholder generator marker
 * {@link ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator}; former by using explicit generator.
 * Object id has to be serialized as a property in case of POJOs;
 * object identity is currently NOT support for JSON Array types
 * (Java arrays or Lists) or Java Map types.
 *<p>
 * Finally, note that generator type of {@link ObjectIdGenerators.None}
 * indicates that no Object Id should be included or used: it is included
 * to allow suppressing Object Ids using mix-in annotations.
 * 
 * @since 2.0
