/**
 * Marker annotation that indicates that all properties that have
 * type annotated with this annotation
 * are to be ignored during serialization and deserialization.
 *<p>
 * Note that this does NOT mean that properties included by annotated
 * type are ignored. Given hypothetical types:
 *<pre>
 *  {@code @JsonIgnoreType}
 *  class Credentials {
 *     public String password;
 *  }
 *
 *  class Settings {
 *     public int userId;
 *     public String name;
 *     public Credentials pwd;
 *  }
 *</pre>
 * serialization of {@code Settings} would only include properties "userId"
 * and "name" but NOT "pwd", since it is of type annotated with {@code @JsonIgnoreType}.
 *<p>
 * Note: annotation does have boolean 'value' property (which defaults
 * to 'true'), so that it is actually possible to override value
 * using mix-in annotations. Usually value is not specified as it defaults
 * to {@code true} meaning annotation should take effect.
