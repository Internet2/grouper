 * Author: Mark Claassen
 * <p>
 * Uses some code from EasySSLProtocolSocketFactory.java
 * 
 * <p>
 * Wraps a SSLSocketFactory with a SecureProtocolSocketFactory.
 * <p>
 * This was designed to make HttpClient work in situations where an application is being deployed by
 * Java Web Start. In these cases, SSL connections are negotiated by webstart implementations of the
 * KeyManager and TrustManager. Wrapping the socket factory obtained from
 * HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultSocketFactory allows the use of HttpClient while still leveraging
 * Java Web Start's handling of SSL certificates
