/**
 * Provides Base32 encoding and decoding in a streaming fashion (unlimited size). When encoding the default lineLength
 * is 76 characters and the default lineEnding is CRLF, but these can be overridden by using the appropriate
 * constructor.
 * <p>
 * The default behavior of the Base32InputStream is to DECODE, whereas the default behavior of the Base32OutputStream
 * is to ENCODE, but this behavior can be overridden by using a different constructor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since this class operates directly on byte streams, and not character streams, it is hard-coded to only encode/decode
 * character encodings which are compatible with the lower 127 ASCII chart (ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, UTF-8, etc).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can set the decoding behavior when the input bytes contain leftover trailing bits that cannot be created by a valid
 * encoding. These can be bits that are unused from the final character or entire characters. The default mode is
 * lenient decoding.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Lenient: Any trailing bits are composed into 8-bit bytes where possible. The remainder are discarded.
 * <li>Strict: The decoding will raise an {@link IllegalArgumentException} if trailing bits are not part of a valid
 * encoding. Any unused bits from the final character must be zero. Impossible counts of entire final characters are not
 * allowed.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When strict decoding is enabled it is expected that the decoded bytes will be re-encoded to a byte array that matches
 * the original, i.e. no changes occur on the final character. This requires that the input bytes use the same padding
 * and alphabet as the encoder.
 * </p>
