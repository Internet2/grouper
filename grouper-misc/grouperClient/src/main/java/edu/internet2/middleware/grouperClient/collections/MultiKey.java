/** 
 * A <code>MultiKey</code> allows multiple map keys to be merged together.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this class is to avoid the need to write code to handle
 * maps of maps. An example might be the need to lookup a filename by 
 * key and locale. The typical solution might be nested maps. This class
 * can be used instead by creating an instance passing in the key and locale.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * // populate map with data mapping key+locale to localizedText
 * Map map = new HashMap();
 * MultiKey multiKey = new MultiKey(key, locale);
 * map.put(multiKey, localizedText);
 *
 * // later retireve the localized text
 * MultiKey multiKey = new MultiKey(key, locale);
 * String localizedText = (String) map.get(multiKey);
 * </pre>
