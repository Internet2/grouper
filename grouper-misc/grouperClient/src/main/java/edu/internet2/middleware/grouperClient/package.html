Grouper client is a command line utility or java jar for Grouper, LDAP, and custom functions.
It consists of one jar, and any included libraries are in a different package structure
than the original so that they can co-exist with the other libraries.  The entry point is
the class: GrouperClient.  The web service interaction is REST, with generally the non-lite
operations

These are the packages:

api: if using grouper client as a jar, this is the API to use (or GrouperClient class)
examples: some examples of longhand calls. 
util: utility methods

The src/ext folder has all external packages in a consistent package structure.

The build script will build the external source with compiling jars, but then when running
they arent needed.

The logging in a refactored commons-logging which will look for the real log4j, and if not
there, will use an internal log4j

with institutional defaults.

The usage doc is configurable per institution, and gives all the commands available
through the client.
