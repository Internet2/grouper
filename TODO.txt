* Tasks
  * "Grouper should work with Hibernate 3"
    * Estimate:           20 hours
    * Source:             blair christensen <blair@devclue.com>   
    * Type:               developer
    * Acceptance Tests:
      * [ ] All current Grouper API acceptance tests pass with Hib2 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API acceptance tests pass with Hib3 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API unit tests pass with Hib2 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API unit tests pass with Hib3 DAO.
    * Notes:  This can be done for the most part by cut-and-pasting the
              current Hibernate DAO code into a new package and renaming the
              classes, etc.  Not ideal but it should work.  The idea will be
              to support both Hib2 and Hib3 for one major release cycle.  Hib2
              will be eliminated (or shoved out into an extension?) after that.
  * "Group attributes can have more than one value"
    * Estimate:           20 hours
    * Source:             blair christensen <blair@devclue.com>
    * Type:               developer
    * Acceptance Tests:
      * [ ] Can set multiple values for a group attribute.
      * [ ] Deleting a group attribute deletes all values.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API acceptance tests pass with Hib2 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API acceptance tests pass with Hib3 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API unit tests pass with Hib2 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API unit tests pass with Hib3 DAO.
    * Notes:  Add idx and klass columns to the "attributes" table.  To keep
              things simple all group attributes - unless otherwise enforced
              by the code - can be multivalued.  
  * "Fields can be associated with more than one group type"
    * Estimate:           20 hours
    * Source:             blair christensen <blair@devclue.com>
    * Type:               developer
    * Acceptance Tests:
      * [ ] Field can be assigned to multiple group types.
      * [ ] Deleting field from one type does not delete it from other group types.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API acceptance tests pass with Hib2 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API acceptance tests pass with Hib3 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API unit tests pass with Hib2 DAO.
      * [ ] All current Grouper API unit tests pass with Hib3 DAO.
    * Notes:  Use the now generic "attributes" table to store type-field
              assignments.
  * "Create a spike solution for converting the XML import process from DOM to SAX"
    * Estimate:           5 hours
    * Source:             blair christensen <blair@devclue.com>
    * Type:               developer
    * Acceptance Tests:   
      * [ ] Must resolve feasibility of implementing a SAX-based importer
    * Notes:
  * "Create a spike solution for converting the XML export process so that the XML is not hand-coded"
    * Estimate:           10 hours
    * Source:             blair christensen <blair@devclue.com>
    * Type:               developer
    * Acceptance Tests:
      * [ ] Must resolve feasibility of creating alternate XML export process
    * Notes:  XStream is probably the starting point for exploration
