- All of the config files which have ".example" in them are examples of the real config files, with the same name without the ".example" in the name
- So copy each of the *.example* files to a name without .example in it, and customize to your environment.
- e.g. copy sources.example.xml to sources.xml, then customize
- the .example shows you which files need customization, and will not prompt you to commit the real file to CVS (since it is ignored and not stored in CVS)
- note some files without .example also might need customization (e.g. grouper.properties)
