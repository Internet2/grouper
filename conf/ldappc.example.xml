            * <source-subject-identifier> is a required element that identifies
            * for a given Subject Source the Subject naming attribute to be used for 
            * identifying Subjects in the directory, and an LDAP search filter
            * that will uniquely identify Subjects for the Source using the
            * given naming attribute value. It requires two attributes that define
            * the Subject Source and the Subject naming attribute.
            *
            *   initial-cache-size - Optional attribute specifying the initial cache
            *      size to use for caching subject DNs by subject ID. Specifying a
            *      larger number than the number of subjects should give better
            *      performance.
            *
            *   source - The name of the Subject Source (e.g., "g:gsa")
            *
            *   subject-attribute - The name of the Subject naming attribute to
            *      be used (e.g., "account"). If a value other than "id" (the subject
            *      ID) is specified, the performance will suffer as an extra lookup
            *      will need to be performed. It is recommended that the subject ID
            *      be in the subject's directory object and that it be indexed.

                * LDAP search filter that uniquely identifies a Subject from the

                *
                *   scope - Identifies the scope of the search.  The valid values
                *      are, ignoring case, the names of the JNDI scope constants
                *      defined in the class javax.naming.directory.SearchContext.
