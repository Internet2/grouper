Welcome to _Grouper_.  

This file is intended to give you a brief overview of how this
directory tree is structured and how to get started with compiling,
testing, and running Grouper.

## Project Layout

See _doc/LAYOUT_ for more information.

---

## Building

    % ant build

---

## Testing

First, create the HSQLDB database and load it with some default data:

    % ant db-init db-init-test

Now, run the Grouper test suite.

    % ant test

Do not be surprised if you receive (some) warnings during the running
of the test suite.  Some tests call code that will fail and send
warning messages to log4j, some of which may end up on the console.

If the test suite fails, it may leave the HSQLDB database in an
state different from what the test harness is expecting.  To remedy
this, rerun the database initialization commands specified above.

---

## Installing

  % ant dist

This will build _Grouper.jar_ and _Grouper-lib.jar_ files in the
_dist/lib_ directory.  

--

## Configuring

Before using Grouper, you should adjust two configuration parameters
and change relative paths to absolute paths.  

In _conf/hibernate.properties_, change:
  hibernate.connection.url

In _conf/log4j.properties_, change:
log4j.appender.rfile.File

---

## Using

You may now try using any of the sample contributed programs (located
in _contrib/_) or your own Grouper code.  You will need to add the
following to your _$CLASSPATH_ to use Grouper:

* Path to _Grouper.jar_
* Path to _Grouper-lib.jar_
* Path to Grouper configuration directory
