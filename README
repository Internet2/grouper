# Grouper README

Welcome to _Grouper_.  

This file is intended to give you a brief overview of how this
directory tree is structured and how to get started with compiling,
testing, and running Grouper.

We will start with the project layout and then move on to building
Grouper, testing Grouper, and building Grouper's javadoc documentation.

## Building

    % ant build

---

## Testing

First, create the HSQLDB database and load it with some default data:

    % ant db-init db-init-test

Now, run the Grouper test suite.

    % ant test

Do not be surprised if you receive (some) warnings during the running
of the test suite.  Some tests call code that will fail and send
warning messages to log4j, some of which may end up on the console.

If the test suite fails, it may leave the HSQLDB database in an
state different from what the test harness is expecting.  To remedy
this, rerun the database initialization commands specified above.
