/ RUBBISH TO ORGANIZE /
----------------------

- Is this correct?  Or should it reflect the additional types of
  privileges?
   member:hasPriv (subjectID, groupName, CREATE || VIEW || READ || UPDATE || DELETE)
- How does one specify *everyone can join* for an optin list?
  - Does one take the same approach for optouts?
    - I suppose one could just have a group of *everyone*
      - Should the default be 'everyone' or 'nobody'?
- optouts/views formatting
- Consistent use of "opt(in|out)/opt-(in|out)"
- 'admin' is all inclusive
- "Likewise, search hits for groups and membership specifications for
  groups are filtered by the subject's viewing privilege,"
  - Does viewing only allow the display of the group's existence or
    does it also allow display of members?
  - What is meant by "membership specifications"?
- Optional namespace for personal groups that is site-configurable?
- General questions/concerns about the security model and the extension
  of the security model that I can't exactly formulate.  Something is
  bugging me but I'm not sure what.

- ??? Where/When is cf sucked in?
  - cf jsp case
    - remind myself how jsps work
      - when 
  - Grouper object as singleton?
- XXX each instance of the grouper class represent single groups
- ??? maintenance of member table; how do we add new members?
  - NOTE: 'members', *not* 'membership' table
    - separate program for batch/diff mods to 'members' table?  Or do
      we go through the API?

- XXX Make note of all site configurable options
