## Project Layout

See _doc/LAYOUT_ for more information.

---

## Building

    % ant build

Build Grouper from source.

---

## Initializing Database

    % ant db-init

This initializes the Groups Registry with Grouper's default tables and
schema.

---

## Testing

    % ant test

This adds some test subjects to the Groups Registry and then runs the
Grouper test suite.

---

## Installing

  % ant dist

This will build _Grouper.jar_ and _Grouper-lib.jar_ files in the
_dist/lib_ directory.  The latter is a rollup .jar of all the third
party .jar files that Grouper relies upon.

--

## Configuring

Before using Grouper, you should adjust two configuration parameters
and change relative paths to absolute paths.  

In _conf/hibernate.properties_, change:
  hibernate.connection.url

In _conf/log4j.properties_, change:
  log4j.appender.rfile.File

---

## Using

You may now try using any of the sample contributed programs (located
in _contrib/_) or your own Grouper code.  You will need to add the
following to your _$CLASSPATH_ to use Grouper:

* Path to _Grouper.jar_
* Path to _Grouper-lib.jar_
* Path to Grouper configuration directory
