# KNOWN ISSUES

* Test Failures 
  "TestGroup43" and "TestStem12" will periodically fail.  If they do, please
  try running the tests again before reporting a problem.  I hope to resolve
  this problem shortly.

* Effective Membership Performance
  Operations that perform large numbers of membership changes continue to be
  slow.  I had managed to speed them up but then I realized that releases 1.1.0
  and earlier of the Grouper API were buggy and did not update the "modify*"
  attributes.  Fixing that bug has wiped out almost all performance gains in
  this section of code.

  Right now effective membership logging many of the performance problems.  If
  you need more speed I recommend disabling one-or-all of the following,
  especially during large batch operations.  These configuration parameters
  can be found in "GROUPER_HOME/conf/grouper.properties".

      memberships.log.group.effective.add = false
      memberships.log.group.effective.del = false
      memberships.log.stem.effective.add  = false
      memberships.log.stem.effective.del  = false
